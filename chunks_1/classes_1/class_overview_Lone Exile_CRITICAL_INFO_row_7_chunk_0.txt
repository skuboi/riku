Title: Lone Exile

Overview:  
Lone Exiles are aggressive Defenders whose swift, deadly slash strikes draw foes in only to mow them down, and function similarly to [[Dunban]] in that they generate aggro primarily by inflicting large amounts of burst damage. While they gain further attack boosts at low health, they lack any inherent means of enhancing their survivability, which can be an issue in prolonged battles. It is the class of [[Ashera]].

It is unlocked by completing the [[Hero Quest]] ''[[The Wrath of Ashera]]''. The [[Class Rank (XC3)|Class Rank]] maximum is increased to 20 after completing the Ascension Quest ''[[A Deep-Seated Scar]]''.
