Title: Master Driver

Overview:  
Master Driver is [[Rex]]'s class, based on his status as the [[Driver|Master Driver]] in {{XC2}}. As a Master Driver, Rex wields the [[Aegis|Firelight Swords]], two swords that are almost identical to [[Pyra]] and [[Mythra]]'s Aegis Swords, but with the Aegis [[Core Crystal]] absent from the swords. He can also combine the two swords into a third sword that closely resembles [[Pneuma]]'s Aegis Sword with the additional blades of energy that appear when charged with energy from [[Siren]]. Rex's [[Battle Arts (XC3)|arts]] in battle primarily consist of his Aegis Sword [[Battle Arts (XC2)|Driver Arts]] from {{XC2|-}}, along with two additional arts that each resemble arts used by [[Zeke]] and [[MÃ²rag]]. His Talent Art is [[Infinity Blade (XC2)|Infinity Blade]], the attack he and Pneuma used to defeat [[Malos]].

The class focuses primarily on potent area of effect attacks that are especially effective at scoring critical hits.

After completing the [[Challenge Battle Mode|Challenge Battle]] ''[[The Two Saviors]]'', Rex can use the class in the main game as a [[Hero]], but the class cannot be used by anyone else. The class functions the same, but doesn't have [[Sword Bash]] as an art.
