'''Isurd''' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|&#12452;&#12473;&#12523;&#12462;}}, ''Isurugi'') is a character in {{XC3}}.

== Overview ==
Isurd is the commander of [[Colony Lambda]], an [[Agnus|Agnian]] mining [[Colony]] located at the [[Great Cotte Falls]]. He is also known as "Dawnhero Isurd", being one of the nation's best strategists. He was once a mentor to [[Taion]], taking him under his wing to train him up as a [[Tactician]] until he was transferred to [[Colony Gamma]].

He can be recruited as a [[Hero]] after completing the [[Hero Quest]] ''[[Unwavering Resolve]]''. His [[Class Rank (XC3)|Class Rank]] can be increased to 20 by completing the Ascension Quest ''[[Effervescent Heart]]''.

== Story ==
[[File:Isurd cadensia.jpg|thumb|210px|Isurd overlooking Erythia Sea]]
Roughly five years before the beginning of the story, Colony Lambda was on an expedition to the [[Cadensia Region]], but was attacked by [[Keves Forces|Kevesi soldiers]] under the cover of dark, resulting in Isurd being injured, and his squad routed. However, he was saved and treated by [[Nimue]] of the [[Lost Colony]]. After recovering, he left the Colony along with Nimue, bringing her back to Colony Lambda. Eventually, Isurd became the commander of the Colony, with Nimue as his right hand strategist. Together, the two mentored Taion in tactics and strategy, both thinking highly of his potential. However, when one of Taion's plans failed in battle against [[Colony 13]] in the [[Urayan Tunnels]], Nimue sacrificed herself to save Taion. As a result, both Isurd and Taion were filled with regret, and Taion lost confidence in his abilities, leading to Taion giving Isurd Nimue's pocket watch, and Isurd sending Taion to Colony Gamma to restore his confidence and emotional state. Some time after losing to Colony 13, Isurd heavily invested in Auto-Levs to nullify the poisonous smokescreen tactics of Colony 13, resulting in their rematch ending in victory. 

[[File:Mudpuppet Isurd.jpg|left|thumb|210px|Isurd confronting the party]]
During the main story, Isurd is visted by [[Consul]] [[Joran|J]], who shows him a live view of the party traveling through [[Rae-Bel Tableland]], and is then asked to take them out. However, Isurd would prefer to question them before fighting as Taion is a part of them, which leads to J using his ability to search Isurd's soul and find his regret of not being able to save Nimue, and makes a mud puppet from those feelings, afterwards incapacitating the real Isurd and the rest of Colony Lambda. The fake Isurd then leads an army of mud puppets, using the poisonous smoke tactics of Colony 13 to attack the party in the Urayan Tunnels. The party escapes, which leads them into the [[Great Cotte Falls]], where the fake Isurd was waiting for them atop the [[Lambda Ferronis]], with an army of [[Levnis]]es and soldiers. The fake Isurd then states his goal was to drive Taion to despair by reminding him of his past mistake in battle against Colony 13, as revenge for letting Nimue die. The fake Isurd then pilots the Ferronis in battle against the party, which leads to the party gaining their second [[Ouroboros]] forms, and the defeat of the false Isurd. Taion then offers his life to satisfy Isurd's anger, but then the fake Isurd dies, and Consul J reveals himself. He explains that the feelings that his mud puppets have are real, including Isurd's hidden contempt towards Taion.

[[File:Resting Isurd.jpg|thumb|210px|Isurd waking up after the battle]]
After the battle against J, the party finds the real Isurd incapacitated, who then wakes up and is informed of what had transpired as he rested. He expresses worry of what his mud puppet might have said towards the party, but Taion lies and says that the mud puppet was just like his normal self. Isurd apologizes for what happened, and returns Nimue's pocket watch to Taion, and tells him of what Nimue thought of him, and that he is not a coward, but overly-considerate of others. He then informs Taion of Nimue's grave in the Cadensia Region, where he asks him to bury the pocket watch. He then allows [[Noah]] and [[Mio]] to see off the mud puppets and lets the party go on their way.

==Gameplay==
Isurd's uses the [[Strategos]] [[Class (XC3)|class]], a [[Healer]] class that specializes in healing allies and weakening enemies.

=== Arts ===
* [[Soulfire (XC3)|Soulfire]], Enemy Attack Down &amp; Heal Party ([[Battle Arts (XC3)#Talent Arts|Talent Art]])
* [[Gyreflow]], Field / Regenerate
* [[Razor Wind]], Heal nearby allies
* [[No Love Lost (XC3)|No Love Lost]], Physical Defense Down
* [[Mirror Trap]], AOE / Counter Heal
* [[Moonshadow]], Bind

Isurd's [[Battle Arts (XC3)|Chain Art]] is [[War of Attrition]], and his Heroic Chain bonus grants an automatic Bravo! (150% TP) ranking if he completes a chain order. However, if he should exceed 150% TP normally, it will be reduced to exactly 150%, preventing an Amazing! rating if he finishes the order.

=== Base Stats ===
These are Isurd's raw stats prior to modifications by class. They serve as a baseline for calculating his stats in the Strategos class (see its page for the corresponding multipliers which adjust these stats). Intermediate values are linearly interpolated between these base stats.

== Trivia ==
* Jingoistic Gigantus bares some similarities with the [[Territorial Rotbart (XC1)|Territorial]] [[Territorial Rotbart (XC2)|Rotbart]] from {{XC}} and {{XC2}}. All three of them are red-furred Gogol, [[Unique Monster (XC1)|Unique]] [[Unique Monster (XC2)|Monsters]] found around level 80 and are encountered early on when the party is low-level.  All three in turn also share a similarity with [[Hayreddin, the Territorial]] from {{XCX}}, though that character is a red-haired [[Simius]], as the planet [[Mira]] has no Gogols.

'''Joran''' is a character in {{XC3}}.

== Overview ==
Joran was a childhood friend of [[Noah]], [[Lanz]], and [[Eunie]] and from [[Colony 14]]. He was a healer class, and wielded a healing rod. He could place regeneration fields, similarly to Eunie. He was kindhearted, although weak and clumsy.

== Story ==
Joran was originally a soldier of [[Keves]] and a friend of Noah, Lanz, and Eunie. Though kindhearted, he was clumsy and a poor fighter, only being good at healing and subsequently was mocked and scorned by many of his peers, though [[Garvel]] did at one point admit he was a good healer during a confrontation. He later died in an [[Agnus]] raid in order to save Lanz' life, and he was subsequently resurrected as a [[Consul]] by [[Z]], renamed '''J''', in the process remembering the deaths of all his previous selves, several of which occurred at the hands of his own supposed allies, and realizing he has always been unsuited for war. The knowledge of his previous deaths always being ignoble at best drove him insane, and he came to see his own strength as the only thing worth caring about and his original kind nature was overtaken by a childish spitefulness driven by his deep envy of his friends being strong enough to make their own way in the world, which J believed was impossible for himself.   

Though neither Joran's identity as [[Moebius]], nor the fact that Moebius could interlink with one another were revealed at this time, his first appearance as Moebius was the first battle against the [[Moebius D &amp; J|Mysterious Giant]] form when [[D]] and J interlinked. D's base Moebius form lacks its horns in all appearances and his horns only seem to appear when interlinked with J. His silhouette can also be seen when D first returns to the other Consuls following the battle.

As a Consul, J was put in charge of [[Colony Lambda]]. He is seen visiting [[Isurd]] during the main story, tasking him with hunting down the [[Ouroboros]]. He developed the ability to create "mudpuppets", sentient lifeforms made of soil and implanted with traumatic memories of living soldiers to become clones of them driven utterly by those memories. As a result of Isurd not wishing to fight the party, he created a mudpuppet of him, formed from his lingering grudges against [[Taion]] for the death of [[Nimue]], sending it to destroy him despite the real Isurd having long since forgiven Taion. After the mudpuppet fails to defeat the party, J himself confronts the Ouroboros in combat, stating his joy for becoming a Moebius. The revelation of his identity also causes Lanz a great deal of internal conflict upon seeing the person who saved his life become Moebius.

Joran, alongside D in their interlinked form, confronts the party again at [[Keves Castle]] before they attempt to destroy the [[Annihilator]], taunting them repeatedly. It is also revealed that Joran kept his healing powers from before he was a Moebius, as revealed when he healed his Interlinked form after Taion's Mondo explosion. The Consuls have the edge for most of the battle but they are defeated by Eunie and Taion's [[Ouroboros]] after Eunie overcomes her trauma induced fear for D and they both outsmart the interlinked Moebius by bypassing D's echolocation by planting Mondos above him. 

Joran then reveals himself in [[Cloudkeep]] alongside D after seemingly killing [[Nia]], and they both confront the party. After the initial fight against both separate Moebius, Noah, Eunie and Lanz collectively try to reach out to Joran, who exclaims that they have no idea how people like him felt living under everyone's shadow. The party, however, manage to get through to him, explaining how much he used to mean to them and how he does not belong with Moebius, however as he is considering the party's statements and seemed willing to renounce Moebius for good, D bashes his head in, forcing him into an [[Interlink]], with D's self being dominant and insulting and talking down to him, which cemented in him that he was only a tool to Moebius and that the party were the ones who actually cared for him. 

Once the party defeat the interlinked form of D, Joran instates control and begins to violently absorb [[Black Fog]] into his and D's Interlinked form with the intention for their form to implode and kill both D and himself, all while D requests more power, with Joran rhetorically asking if D really thought he really was a loser now, he continues to assert control over the form also forcing their interlinked form to step backwards and then jump off prior to the explosion to protect the party. They both die and the party mourns his death, realizing he would not be reborn within [[Aionios]] because he was a Moebius, though finding closure in his sacrifice and final renunciation of Moebius. 

After [[Origin]] is reactivated and the worlds of the [[Bionis]] and [[Alrest]] are reconstructed, Joran, no longer a Moebius, appears alongside a young Eunie and Lanz who call out to a young Noah to join the group else he will miss the festivities.

=== Arts ===
Moebius J has the same Arts set as in the story boss fight, with the exception that he does not use any version of Decoy Soul. Additionally, all of his Arts may be used at any time, except for Farewell, My Puppet, which is only used if Moebius D is defeated.

== Etymology ==
Joran's name may be derived from the Swedish name G&#246;ran or J&#246;ran, meaning "farmer" or "earth-worker".

== Trivia ==
* J's jester-like cap in his Consul and Moebius forms may allude to the [[wikipedia:Joker_(playing_card)|Joker]] card, and his moniker of "J" may be a nod to this. Additionally, Joran's backstory of perceived uselessness may also be a reference to the Joker card, which is known for not being used in serious card games.
* At some point, Joran was intended to be a [[Hero]], but was dropped and left [[List of Xenoblade Chronicles 3 pre-release and unused content|unused]] in the files of {{XC3|-}}.
* Joran's English voice actor, Gerran Howell, also voices [[Milton]] in {{TTGC|full}}.

'''Juniper''' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|&#12518;&#12474;&#12522;&#12495;}}, '''Yuzuriha''') is a character in {{XC3}}.

== Overview ==
Juniper, also known as Ghostbow Juniper (Japanese: {{Lang|jp|&#20762;&#24358;&#12398;&#12518;&#12474;&#12522;&#12495;}}), is the commander of [[Colony Tau]], where they usually live quietly in the forest. Juniper is a companionable person and is trusted by their [[Colony Tau|colony]] mates. Juniper is very agile and can move easily on trees and thin ropes. Juniper is an [[Agnus|Agnian]] human with [[Gormotti]] and [[Flesh Eater|Blade Eater]] traits.

Juniper becomes a [[Hero]] after completing ''[[Natural Selection]]''. Their [[Class Rank (XC3)|Class Rank]] is increased to 20 by completing the [[Hero Quest|Ascension Quest]] ''[[Survivors]]''.

== Gameplay ==
Juniper uses the [[Stalker]] [[Class (XC3)|Class]], an [[Attacker]] class that wields the [[Blade (XC3)|Luminescent Bow]] and specializes in attacking [[Enemy (XC3)|enemies]]' blind spots for a stealthy elimination. Juniper's [[Battle Arts (XC3)|Chain Art]] is Radiant Cascade and their Heroic Chain bonus increases the damage ratio by 10 percentage points when they are chosen.

=== Base Stats ===
These are Juniper's raw stats prior to modifications by class. They serve as a baseline for calculating Juniper's stats in the Stalker class (see its page for the corresponding multipliers which adjust these stats). Intermediate values are linearly interpolated between these base stats.
{| class="xc1 centered" width="80%"
! Level !! HP !! Attack !! Healing Power !! Dexterity !! Agility
|-
| 1 || 319 || 19 || 18 || 33 || 23
|-
| 99 || 6,378 || 381 || 365 || 327 || 234
|}

=== General Stats ===
These stats assume Juniper is at rank 20 in their class. Stat increases from gems are shown separately from the base stat, and may not fully apply if Juniper has not unlocked the corresponding gem slots.

{| class="xc1 centered" width="100%"
! Level !! HP !! Attack
! Healing Power !! Dexterity !! Agility !! Critical Rate !! Block Rate !! Physical Defense !! Ether Defense
|-
| 1||223||38 (+20)||4||42||29||20%||3%||15%||15%
|-
| 99||4,464||973 (+70)||91||425||304||30%||6%||15%||15%
|}

Juniper equips the following gems:
* [[Disperse Bloodlust]]
* [[Steelcleaver]], at level 20 onwards
* [[Analyze Weakness]], at level 40 onwards

Juniper equips the following accessories as their default accessories, which can be changed in post-game or [[New Game + (XC3)|New Game+]]. All equipped accessories assume their Common variant.

* [[Beast Mask]]
* [[Repulsor Cuffs]], at level 30 onwards
* [[Comet Choker (XC3)|Comet Choker]], at level 50 onwards

== Etymology ==
[[wikipedia:Juniper|Junipers]] are a family of coniferous trees. Their [[wikipedia:&#12518;&#12474;&#12522;&#12495;|Japanese name]] {{lang|ja|&#12518;&#12474;&#12522;&#12495;}} (Yuzuriha) is the common name for [[wikipedia:Daphniphyllum macropodum|Daphniphyllum macropodum]], a shrub or small tree found in China, Japan and Korea. The timber is used in China in construction and furniture making. It is grown as an ornamental plant, chiefly for its foliage.

== Notes ==
* &#8251; There is no specified or no defined [[wikipedia:gender identity|gender identity]] for or by Juniper in-game, unlike for the other main or Hero characters. According to the game files, the internal values assigned to the "gender" of the characters are 0 for male, 1 for female, and the undefined value 2, which was assigned to the character Juniper. For this reason, Juniper's gender identity is expressed by the [[wikipedia:Non-binary gender|non-binary gender]] umbrella term or the [[wikipedia:X-gender|X-gender]] umbrella term in Japan. Moreover, [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10002017/ Lilly Hart]&lt;ref&gt;[https://shelleybarrettmanagement.co.uk/lilly-hart-in-xenoblade-chronicles-3-on-nintendo-switch/]&lt;/ref&gt; who voices Juniper in the English version&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Lilly-Hart/]&lt;/ref&gt;, confirmed the non-binarity of their gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.instagram.com/p/CgtmgMBIt5i/]&lt;/ref&gt; More information is reported [[Juniper/Notes|here]].
