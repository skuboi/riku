[[File:XC3 Annihilator Keves.PNG|thumb|Keves Castle Annihilator]]
The '''Annihilator''' is a structure and weapon in {{XC3}}. It harnesses the power of [[Black Fog]] to weaponize the [[Annihilation Event]] phenomenon. There are two known in existence, one for each [[nation]]'s [[Castle]].
{{clr}}

== Design and Function ==
[[File:XC3 Annihilator and Castle Blueprint.PNG|thumb|210px|left|Annihilator and Castle 3D Diagram]]
The [[Keves]] Annihilator matches its castle in color design, prominently dark gray with gold highlights, and purple and blue lighting. It is attached to a circular rail on the exterior of [[Keves Castle]], held in place by the main housing, using the Auto Balancer to counteract the massive weight of the barrel. Consequently, this means that the entire weight of the barrel rests on the Auto Balancer, creating a major weak point in its construction. The Annihilator barrel itself is protected by four sections of an outer shell, which can retract to reveal the power converter. The sections of the outer shell can be seen emitting purple electricity which the central power converter draws upon to emit its projectile. The energy for the Annihilator is acquired by the Castle's [[Flame Clock]] absorbing the surrounding Black Fog. This energy is then condensed and stored in the center of the castle, in an area known as the neutralizer assembly, which renders the Black Fog inactive. Finally, the energy is transmitted through the outer rails and into the Annihilator. Due to the barrel needing a vast amount of energy, a massive refrigeration unit was installed on the ring to cool the incoming energy from the rail. The Annihilator has no limit to its range.

The [[Agnus]] Annihilator also matches its Castle's design, being prominently white, with highlights of gold and red, while emitting a green light. The central power converter design is also the same as the Keves Annihilator's. However, there are a few other differences. Firstly, the barrel of the Annihilator is not attached to a rail like the one in Keves Castle, rather protruding and retracting from [[Agnus Castle]] itself. It also only has two sections of its outer shell, bearing a design resemblance to a [https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Railgun railgun].

== Story ==
[[File:Annihilator destroying Uraya.gif|thumb|210px|Annihilator firing on the Urayan Mountains]]
The Annihilator is first seen when the party overlooks Keves Castle in [[Chapter 4 (XC3)|Chapter 4]], although too far away to be clearly seen. Later in that same cutscene [[Ethel]] and [[Bolearis]] are seen in a meeting with the [[Queen of Keves]] and [[Consul]] [[N]]. N is then seen interacting with a blue hologram under the Queen's orders which slowly turns green. Afterwards, the Annihilator is seen moving along a circular rail, in response to N's actions. Ethel and Bolearis are then shown a hologram projection of the Annihilator, which is shown shooting its projectile on the [[Uraya|Urayan Mountains]], causing a large Annihilation Effect which left a massive crater. The explosion is loud enough for the party to hear and feel nearby, causing them to be confused and worried. Ethel and Bolearis are in awe of its power, but are worried about the soldiers being deprived of life force for their Flame Clocks if it were to be used on Agnus. The Queen then states that they weren't planning on using it against Agnus, but rather Ethel's [[Colony 4]], as punishment for coming into contact with the [[Ouroboros]] and having their Flame Clock destroyed. However, they are given a chance to save the Colony by eliminating the Ouroboros. 

[[File:XC3 Annihilator Exploding.PNG|thumb|210px|left|Annihilator Exploding]]
Ethel then gives Bolearis the schematics of the Castle and Annihilator, who then managed to escape from the Castle. Meanwhile in [[High Maktha Wildwood]], [[Mio]] hears something in the bushes, which is revealed to be Bolearis, who gives the party the schematics. Mio then manages to connect the explosion and light they saw earlier to the Annihilator, and resolves to destroy it, along with the rest of the party. After making their way to the [[Keves Castle Region]], [[Noah]] and [[Taion]] discuss their infiltration plan, settling on sneaking into the castle, taking the maintenance hatch, and destroying the Auto Balancer. However once they reach the [[Annihilator Foundations]], they are blocked by [[Moebius D &amp; J]], which the party then fight. While in the middle of the fight, [[Riku]] and [[Manana]] notice the Annihilator drawing energy through the rails. But no matter how much the party tries, Moebius D &amp; J manage to stop them before they can destroy the Auto Balancer. But then [[Eunie]] comes up with a plan with the help of Taion, where they lured the [[Moebius]] to the Auto Balancer so that Eunie's Ouroboros form can fire fast moving but weak projectiles into it. That way when they transform into Taion's Ouroboros form, the projectiles stuck in the Auto Balancer turn into Taion's exploding Mondo, which promptly detonate and destroy the Auto Balancer, causing the Annihilator collapse under its own weight. While falling, the stored-up energy in the Annihilator causes the barrel itself to undergo the Annihilation Effect, which [[D]] and [[J]] get caught up in, although they survive.

[[File:XC3 Agnus Annihilator.PNG|thumb|210px|Agnus Castle's Annihilator]]
While the Keves Annihilator was destroyed, the Agnus Castle's Annihilator is later seen after the party defeats the [[Queen of Agnus]]. After its defeat, [[X]] activates the Castle's Annihilator and reveals to the party that it will fire on the [[City]] in [[Swordmarch]], whose location was revealed by [[Shania]]. It then fires on Swordmarch where Shania specified it to be shot, leaving a massive crater known as [[The Cavity]]. However, the City was not actually destroyed due to it having been a mobile [[Ferronis]], and already having been warned ahead of time by Mio and [[M]]. During the final battle against [[Z]], [[Nia]] uses the Annihilator after transforming Agnus Castle into a [[Ferronis]] to attack [[Origin]].

The '''Antol''' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|&#12450;&#12531;&#12488;&#12523;}}, ''Antoru'') family is a common but minor family of spider-like creatures in the {{XC|serieslink}}. Their models remain unchanged in each game. '''Kings''' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|&#12461;&#12531;&#12464;}}, ''Kingu'') are giant Antols with two abdomens instead of one, similar to [[Arachno]] Queens.

In {{TTGC}}, [[Cloud Arachno]]s mistakenly use an Antol model; as no other [[Arachno]]s appear in the game, this enemy was likely intended to be an Antol.

== {{XC|-}} ==
In {{XC}}, there are two main types of Antols, red and yellow Antols. Red Antols are sight enemies. Yellow Antols are normal enemies. Antols are found around [[Colony 9 (XC1)|Colony 9]], on [[Bionis' Leg]], outside the walls of [[Colony 6]], in [[Makna Forest]], on [[Valak Mountain]], and on the [[Fallen Arm]]. The strongest Antol is the [[Powerful Eligos]] on the [[Fallen Arm]] and is at level 80.

'''Arachnos''' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|&#12473;&#12497;&#12452;&#12489;}}, ''Supaido''; [[English dub pronunciations|English dub]]: {{IPA|/&#601;&#712;r&#230;kno&#650;/}}) are a type of four-legged, spider-like enemies in the {{XC|serieslink}}. '''Queens''' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|&#12463;&#12452;&#12540;&#12531;}}, ''Ku&#299;n'') are a much larger kind of Arachno with two abdomens instead of one, similar to [[Antol]] Kings.

The [[Cloud Arachno]] uses an Antol model, and was likely intended to be an Antol enemy.

== {{XC|-}} ==
Many species of Arachnos are in the [[:Category:Sound Category|Sound Category]], meaning they attack if the party leader runs while nearby them. Some species can hatch from [[Pod]]s. When [[Reyn]] and [[Shulk]] are in [[Tephra Cave]], they comment on how it looks like they are [[Mechon]] parts inside the pods.

=== Story ===
[[File:Arachno Queen.png|thumb|The Arachno Queen]]
In [[Tephra Cave]], multiple Arachnos attack Shulk and Reyn a short while after the [[Spring of Grief]]. Shulk has a vision where Reyn is killed by the [[Arachno Queen]]. Reyn runs away from the Arachnos, only to end up on the [[Arachno Queen's Nest]]. Shulk's vision is then about to come true, but a new symbol appears on the [[Monado]]. Shulk learns the Monado art, [[Monado Shield (XC1)|Shield]], which protects Reyn. A boss battle with the Arachno Queen and numerous Arachnos then commences.

=== Types of Arachnos ===
There are several high-level species of Arachnos found in [[Tephra Cave]]. Arachnos also can be found on [[Bionis' Leg]], in [[Satorl Marsh]], and on [[Valak Mountain]]. The most powerful Arachno is the [[Unique Monster (XC1)|Unique]] [[Firework Geldesia]] at level 98. It resides in Tephra Cave.

The '''Archsage's Gauntlet''' is a type of [[Challenge Battle Mode|Challenge Battle]] in {{XC3}}. It becomes available after completing ''[[More Challenge Battles!]]''.

== Overview ==
The Archsage's Gauntlet consists of rogue-like challenges. Completing a Gauntlet run rewards Blue [[Noponstone]]s. At the start of each Gauntlet run, the player chooses one member of [[Ouroboros]] to fight several stages, and to clear each stage, all the enemies that appear must be defeated; the exact enemies that appear are randomized with each run. Enemies will increase in level every three stages (boss stages don't count toward this). On every tenth stage, the party will fight [[Boss (XC3)|bosses]], and the bosses encountered are the same every Gauntlet run. The score will rise as the player defeats enemies, and perform battle actions, such as [[Combo]]s.  

If a Gauntlet is tackled with the difficulty set to Hard, [[Noah]] will be unable to use any arts with [[Lucky Seven]] unless the [[Lucky Seven License]] is obtained, meaning that [[Infinity Blade (XC3)|Infinity Blade]] and [[Unlimited Sword]] cannot be used until the License is purchased. 

Due to only one member of Ouroboros being available during a Gauntlet run, [[Interlink]]ing is replaced with the Launch Charge. When activating Launch Charge, all enemies will be [[Launch (XC3)|launched]]. The Launch Charge guage rises as enemies are defeated, and up to three charges can be stored. Using Launch Charge also triggers Bonus Time, during which the score will build up faster than usual for 10 seconds. Attacks dealt to foes during this time will also contribute to the score. If a stage is completed without any party members being incapacitated, the player will receive a score multiplier, and this bonus maxes out after completing five KO-less stages in a row.

There are multiple ways to increase the score:
* Defeat enemies
* Inflict [[Topple (XC3)|Topple]], [[Burst]], or [[Smash (XC3)|Smash]] on enemies.
* Defeat enemies with [[Chain Attack (XC3)|Chain Attacks]].
* Hit enemies with attacks during Bonus Time.
* Receive certain boons through the Archsage's Whimsy.

The following situations will add a multiplier to the score:
* When successive stages have been completed without letting any party member get KO'd.
* During Bonus Time.
* When the effects of certain Emblems are active.

The Nopwatch is another unique feature to the Archsage's Gauntlet. This gauge depletes over time, and when it runs out, the entire party will suffer three penalties. These penalties include greatly reduced HP recovery, rate of recharge, and ally revival speed. The Nopwatch gauge can be refilled by spending score in the shop in-between stages, but the cost will increase with successive acquisition.

Recruited [[Hero]]es will use all the [[Battle Arts (XC3)|Arts]] they have access to, but during Chain Attacks, they'll only be able to use those they have assigned to the Arts Palette. Only Heroes unlocked in the main game can be used during a run.

The Chain Gauge in the Gauntlet is harder to fill than in normal battles. Additionally, selecting a Hero's Chain Order during a Chain Attack will consume the Chain Gauge.

== Gauntlet Shop ==
The score can be used between stages in the shop to recruit up to six Heroes and purchase Emblems with special effects. The shop contents for each stage are chosen at random. 

Shuffle Tickets can be used to change the shop line-up. These can be acquired by defeating fierce enemies at key stages or rarely encountered [[Lucky Monster]]s. Up to three Shuffle Tickets can be carried at once, and the number the player starts each run with will increase as the party allies with more Heroes in the main game.

== Emblems ==
Emblems are items that help the party with special effects. They can be purchased in the shop, and if an emblem that the party has already acquired is purchased at the shop, the Emblem's effect will be further amplified, up to +5. 

Emblems can also be purchased at the [[Prize X-change Blue]] for Blue Noponstone. Previously unlocked Emblems can be strengthened too, up to a maximum of +2. Once upgraded, they'll show up in the Gauntlet shop in their already-strengthened state.

When a locked Emblem is acquired in exchange for Blue Noponstone, that Emblem will be unlocked and available for purchase from the Gauntlet shop.

Some emblems are cursed, meaning that the provided effect will give a buff and a debuff.

== Events and Whimsy ==
Occasionally, an event may occur at the start of a stage. Events can have all sorts of positive or negative effects, ranging from rare enemy spawns to extra enemy reinforcements. The effects of an event last until the end of the current stage.

Sometimes, the Archsage's Whimsy will trigger after the player is finished shopping. The player will be forced to choose between two options, which will confer one of many possible effects. Shuffle Tickets can also be used to change the offered options.

Events and the Archsage's Whimsy do not occur in ''[[Gauntlet: Beginner]]''.

=== List of Events ===
* '''Higher Enemy Value''': Amount of score obtained from enemies is increased.
* '''Higher Enemy Value+''': Amount of score obtained from enemies is greatly increased.
* '''Lower Enemy Value''': Amount of score obtained from enemies is decreased. 
* '''No Enemy Value''': Enemies don't provide any score.
* '''Nopwatch Stays Still''': The Nopwatch pauses.
* '''Nopwatch Depletes Faster''': The Nopwatch depletion speed increases.
* '''Launch Charge Fills Faster''': The Launch Charge gauge fills up faster.
* '''Launch Charge Unusable''': The Launch Charge is disabled.
* '''Lucky Monsters''': Lucky Monsters appear.
* '''Many Lucky Monsters''': Many Lucky Monsters appear.
* '''Moebius Intervention''': A random minor enemy is replaced with a [[Moebius]].
** The following Moebius can be summoned from this event: [[B|Moebius B]], [[E|Moebius E]], [[G|Moebius G]], [[H|Moebius H]], [[Irma|Moebius I]], [[L|Moebius L]], [[Q|Moebius Q]], [[R|Moebius R]], [[U|Moebius U]], [[V|Moebius V]], and [[W|Moebius W]].
