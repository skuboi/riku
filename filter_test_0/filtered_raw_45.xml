{{Quote|The Monado... I hope I can figure out the secret of its power one day.|Shulk}}
The '''Monado''' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|&#12514;&#12490;&#12489;}}) ([[English dub pronunciations|English dub]]: {{IPA|/mo&#712;n&#593;&#720;do&#650;/}}) is a mythical sword in {{XC}}. The reasons of its existence and powers are the core of the story. It is said to be the weapon used by [[Bionis]] in its war with [[Mechonis]].

== Characteristics ==
The Monado is a powerful energy blade that can manipulate the [[ether]] around it, and by doing so, change the material and immaterial shape of the world. One's ability to control the Monado depends on the strength of will of its user; most [[Homs]] who try to use the sword cannot control it. At the beginning of the game, the Monado cannot harm any of the sentient beings (Homs, [[High Entia]], and [[Nopon]]) of Bionis.

The Monado grants its elected wielder the power of foresight. It is said that this is possible because all of the ether in the world is calculable in its changes. This allows the user to see where every ether particle is, was, and will be.

According to Alvis, the Monado emits a particular ether wavelength in its ground state that attracts [[Telethia (XC1)|Telethia]]. Also, the Monado can be counteracted by opposing particles to that of the Monado.

All of the [[Alvis|seers]] must touch the Monado to receive their divination powers.

== Story ==
=== {{XC|-}} ===
==== Creation ====
When [[Klaus]] split the original world with the [[Conduit]], [[Ontos]], one of the three [[Core Crystal|cores]] of the [[Trinity Processor]], was sucked into another dimension alongside half of Klaus's body, which became [[Zanza]], and [[Galea]], who became [[Meyneth]]. At some point, Ontos awakened as [[Alvis]] and created the Monado, eventually bestowing Zanza with its power. Another [[Meyneth Monado|Monado]] was bestowed to Meyneth.

==== The Sword of Bionis ====
[[File:Bionis vs Mechonis DE Intro.jpeg|thumb|270px|Bionis wields the Monado against Mechonis]]
At some point, Zanza's soul became housed inside the Monado, which ended up at what would eventually become the [[Companions' Forum]] on the [[Bionis' Shoulder]]. The Monado ended up being discovered by the [[Giant]] [[Arglas]], who ended up being possessed by Zanza to wage war against Mechonis. After the battle, Zanza's body was imprisoned on [[Prison Island]] and the Monado, with Zanza's soul within, was sealed in Ose Tower, which would become the [[Sealed Tower]].

==== The Monado's Discovery ====
14 years before the events of {{XC|-}}, a group of Homs explorers left [[Colony 9 (XC1)|Colony 9]] in search of the Monado, said to have been wielded as a blade of light by the Bionis itself. Their travels took them to [[Valak Mountain]], where they supposedly disappeared. In truth, when the explorers found the Monado, Zanza's soul inside the sword awakened. In order to replenish his life force, Zanza sucked their life forces, before possessing the body of a young boy who was among the Homs, reviving the boy. Later arrived [[Dickson]], who found the bodies of the research team in the Sealed Tower, next to the Monado. He took the weapon along with the only survivor, who would grow up to be [[Shulk]].

13 years later, the first known Homs wielder of the Monado, [[Dunban]], was able to exercise limited control of the sword and use it as a weapon against the [[Mechon]] at the [[Battle of Sword Valley]]. In doing so, he was able to thwart an attack against Colony 9. Due to sheer discipline and strength, he could wield the blade, even though he could not fully control it. Dunban unwittingly sacrificed the use of his right arm for victory in the battle against the Mechon.

==== The Heir to the Monado ====
[[File:Shulk with Monado 1.jpeg|thumb|left|Shulk wields the Monado for the first time]]
Shulk dedicated his entire life to solving the secrets of the Monado and thus is not only able to wield the blade without problems, but also able to unlock its great power. Shulk experiences this great power for the first time when he sees the future while holding the Monado in his [[Weapon Development Lab|laboratory]]. However, he learns that he has no control over what he sees, so he does not know he was granted foresight at the beginning.

When the Mechon attack Colony 9, Dunban joins Shulk and [[Reyn]] wielding the Monado as the latter two are struggling against them in the [[Central Plaza (Colony 9)|Central Plaza]]. As the three of them head to the [[Residential District (XC1)|Residential District]], Dunban, not yet recovered from his injuries, tries to use again the Monado. When the Monado flies out of Dunban's hand, Shulk picks up the Monado. At this point, he unintentionally gains the ability to predict the future. Thanks to the Monado's foresight, Shulk avoids getting killed. However, he is unable to damage [[Metal Face]] in any way with the Monado, which leaves him helpless against the [[Mechon#Faced Mechon|Faced Mechon]] when he kills [[Fiora]].

==== Unlocking the Monado's Powers ====
[[File:Shield Symbol 2.jpg|thumb|150px|Monado Shield]]
Shulk and Reyn decide to avenge Fiora and set out for [[Colony 6]]. While in [[Tephra Cave]], Shulk has a vision of the [[Arachno Queen]] killing Reyn. The prediction proves true when Shulk and Reyn fall into the [[Arachno Queen's Nest]]. Shulk unlocks a new power of the Monado, [[Monado Shield (XC1)|Monado Shield]], allowing him to change the future that the Monado had predicted.

[[File:Shulk learning Monado Purge.jpeg|thumb|left|Shulk activates Monado Purge]]
While looking for [[Ether Crystal (XC1)|ether crystals]] alone in [[Makna Forest]], Shulk is attacked by [[Telethia (XC1)|Telethia]]. When he tries to confront them, however, he is unable to face them, as they can read his thoughts. However, a mysterious Homs by the name of Alvis takes the Monado and unlocks another of its powers. He explains to Shulk that the Monado does not control its power, but its user does.
{{clr}}

==== Release the Shackles ====
[[File:Monado II Unlocked DE.jpg|thumb|The Monado's shackles are unleashed]]
After arriving in [[Alcamoth]], the High Entia capital, the party learns that the Monado was sealed away by the High Entia forefathers.

When the party follows Emperor [[Sorean]] to [[Prison Island]], they meet a Giant by the name of Zanza, who was also locked away by the same forefathers. He claims to be the creator of the Monado, and offers to remove the restriction that prevent the Monado from harming the sentient beings of Bionis if he is released. Shulk agrees, and even though Zanza is apparently killed by Metal Face, the Monado is released, transforming into the [[Monado II]] in the process, and Shulk can finally harm Faced Mechon like Metal Face. However, he also hears the voice of Zanza through the blade for the first time.

==== Affected by the Apocrypha ====
The leader of Mechonis, the [[Machina]] [[Egil]], uses the [[Apocrypha Generator]], that is located in the [[Central Factory]] from [[Galahad Fortress]], to revert the Monado to its inert state. Even after the battle ends, Shulk still cannot use the Monado. He finally forces it to awaken when protecting a weakened Fiora on the [[Fallen Arm]], but the use of the Monado takes a physical toll on his health.

He learns from the goddess of Mechonis, [[Meyneth]], in [[Agniratha]] that the Monado was used against Mechonis and the Machina by Zanza.

==== Zanza's Return ====
[[file:Zanza Monado DE.png|thumb|left|Zanza with his Monado]]
After the party defeats Egil's Faced Mechon [[Yaldabaoth]], Egil explains that Zanza inhabits the beings of Bionis in order to live, and his soul dwells in the Monado. After Egil tells the story about Zanza, Dickson appears and shoots Shulk with his rifle, revealing himself to be a disciple of Zanza's and a traitor. Zanza leaves Shulk's body while also revealing that the Monado is the weapon of destruction as well as the holder of Zanza's soul. After this revelation, Meyneth comes out from Fiora's body and uses her own Monado to battle Zanza. When Zanza defeats Meyneth, he takes her Monado. With it, Zanza no longer needs to inhabit a living being to survive. However, he did not realise that there was another Monado, [[Monado III|Shulk's Monado]]. 

After losing the Monado, Shulk is given a [[Replica Monado|replica]] of the sword from [[Miqol]].

==== The True Monado ====
[[File:True Monado Finisher.jpg|thumb|right|Shulk uses the True Monado to finish off Zanza]]
During the party's final battle against Zanza, Shulk unlocks the power of the [[Monado III|True Monado]]. Upon overcoming Zanza, a light connects the three Monados (Zanza's, Meyneth's, and Shulk's). After this, Alvis explains that he is Monado, the fabric of reality. He tells Shulk that he can decide the fate of the universe now that he possesses the sword's full power. Shulk decides to create a world with no need for gods, refusing to become a god and giving up both his Monado and his power to see the future in the process.

=== {{XCFC|sub}} ===
==== Shulk's Personal Monado ====
At some point after the world's recreation, Shulk constructed his own replica of the Monado, the [[Monado Replica EX]], based on the prototypes built by Miqol, which is able to use most of the same abilities as the Monado. He uses this new weapon while on the Bionis' Shoulder. Later on, Shulk, with help from [[Radzam]], upgrades it into the [[Monado Replica EX+]] in order to defeat the [[Fog King]].

=== {{XC3FR|-}} ===
==== Alpha and A's Monados ====
The Monado in its original form reappears in {{XC3FR}}, wielded by [[Alpha]]. When Alpha transforms into his final form during the final battle, the Monado transforms as well. Another version of the Monado, this one with a more slender appearance, also appears as [[A]]'s [[Blade (XC3)|Blade]]. Additionally, Shulk wields his Monado REX+ as his Blade. A's Monado and Shulk's Monado REX+ are among the few weapons capable of destroying [[Ferronis]] [[Flame Clock]]s.
{{clr}}

== Arts ==
Shulk can select Monado Arts by activating his [[Battle_Arts_(XC1)#Talent_Arts|Talent Art]], Activate Monado, granting access to the weapon's most powerful abilities. Buster and Enchant are available upon obtaining the Monado; additional Arts are unlocked through story progression or side quest completion. Monado Arts can be upgraded like typical Battle Arts, but are initially capped at level 4. After the events on Prison Island, all Monado Arts can be upgraded to level 10. In {{XCDE|sub}}, Monado Arts are the only Arts with upgrades that can not reach level 12, as they do not have corresponding [[Levelling_Battle_Arts#Art_Books|Master Books]]. Shulk's Monado Arts include the following:  

* '''{{lang|ja|&#26028;}}''' [[Monado Buster|Buster]]: Powerful attack with a larger blade in a straight line ahead. Deals double damage to Mechon and [[Machina]].
* '''{{lang|ja|&#24375;}}''' [[Monado Enchant|Enchant]]: Strengthens the weapons of the party. Allows normal weapons to damage Mechon. (Unavailable in {{XCFC|sublink}})
* '''{{lang|ja|&#30462;}}''' [[Monado Shield (XC1)|Shield]]: Generates a barrier that protects the party from enemy Talent Arts of the same level or lower.
* '''{{lang|ja|&#30142;}}''' [[Monado Speed|Speed]]: Gives the targeted party member a greater chance to dodge physical attacks.
* '''{{lang|ja|&#30772;}}''' [[Monado Purge|Purge]]: Ranged ether blast that inflicts [[Aura Seal]] and nullifies [[Spike (status)|Spike]] effects.
* '''{{lang|ja|&#37799;}}''' [[Monado Armour|Armour]]: Reduces physical and ether damage taken. Percentage (30%-75%) depends on this Art's level.
* '''{{lang|ja|&#36703;}}''' [[Monado Cyclone|Cyclone]]: Damages all enemies around the user and inflicts topple on enemies suffering from break.
* '''{{lang|ja|&#21936;}}''' [[Monado Eater|Eater]]: Strips away enemy buffs and causes bleed damage in a frontal cone.

The following Arts are only seen in the [[Zanza (boss)|final battle]] and can not be obtained by Shulk during normal gameplay, being exclusively used by the final boss and their [[Zanza Guardian|guardians]].
* Shooter: 8 hit combo, large damage with each shot.
* Brave: strength up and ether up buffs.
* Fear: inflicts strength down and ether down debuffs to the party
* Recover: heals a fairly large amount of health.

== In {{XC2|-}} ==
=== As a Blade Weapon ===
The Monado is Shulk's [[Weapons (XC2)|weapon]] as a [[Blade (XC2)|Blade]] in {{XC2}}. The Monado is a clone of the Shield Hammer weapon, but has faster attacks and is a ATK weapon instead of a TNK weapon. It can be used by [[Rex]], [[Nia]], [[M&#242;rag]] and [[Zeke]], each one of them with their own arts, including a variation of [[Monado Shield (XC2)|Monado Shield]] for Rex and Zeke. Shulk himself can use Purge, Cyclone, Buster, and the unique [[Monado Unbound]] as his [[Blade Special|Specials]], and Enchant and Speed as his Battle Skills.

=== Aegis Sword ===
[[File:Malos's Monado Armor.png|thumb|120px|Malos's Monado]]
The [[Aegis|Aegis Swords]] in {{XC2|-}} bear many similarities to the Monado. When [[Malos]] uses his powers as an Aegis during the two boss fights at the [[Cliffs of Morytha]] and the two boss fights in {{TTGC}}, he wields a purple Monado and is able to use the following arts:
* Armor: creates a barrier that surrounds himself and his allies which reduces the time for [[Blade Combo]]s and increases defensive capabilities.
* Buster: causes damage to the enemies in front of him and inflicts [[Blowdown (XC2)|Blowdown]].
* Cyclone: causes damage to all enemies and inflicts Blowdown.
* Eater: causes damage to the enemies in front of him and [[Affinity Down|reduces Blade affinity]].
* Jail: inflicts [[Shackle Blade]] on the entire party.

== In {{XC3|-}} ==
=== As a Weapon Attachment ===
[[File:XC3 Monado Amiibo Screenshot.jpg|thumb|180px|The Monado in {{XC3|-}}]]
In {{XC3}}, scanning the [[Shulk]] [[amiibo]] will unlock a Monado weapon [[Clothing|attachment]] for the [[Swordfighter]] [[Class (XC3)|class]]'s [[Blade (XC3)|Veiled Sword]]. It can also be unlocked by completing the game for the first time on any difficulty. 

=== Monado REX+ Arts ===
In {{XC3|-}} and {{XC3FR|sublink}}, Shulk, as a [[Grand Marshal]], is able to use multiple Monado arts with his Monado REX+. He can use [[Monado Purge#In Xenoblade Chronicles 3: Future Redeemed|Monado Purge]], [[Monado Armour#In Xenoblade Chronicles 3: Future Redeemed|Monado Armor]], and the new [[Monado Rage]] as [[Battle Arts (XC3)|arts]], Buster as his Talent Art, and Cyclone during [[Unity Combo]]s.
{{clr}}

== In the ''Super Smash Bros.'' series ==
[[File:Shulk-Smash Bros Ultimate.jpg|thumb|180px|Shulk wielding the Monado (with the Smash Art activated) in {{SSBU|-}}]]
Shulk is a playable character in {{SSB4}} and {{SSBU}}. He uses the Monado (in its first form) in battle, and when it is activated in battle, Shulk's features and abilities change. These games include two Monado Arts that are not in {{XC|-}}; Jump (&#32724;, lit. "soar"), which gives Shulk higher jumps, a higher-height [[Air Slash (XC1)|Air Slash]] and lower defense, and Smash (&#25731;, lit. "attack/strike"), which gives Shulk stronger knockback/launching power but at the cost of lower damage output and launching resistance. Shulk can also use Speed, which gives Shulk higher movement but at the cost of shorter jumps and a little less damage output, Shield, which increases Shulk's defense and makes him heavier but at the cost of greatly reduced speed, damage output, and jump height, and Buster, which gives Shulk stronger damage outputs but at the cost of lower defense and reduced knockback/launching power.

By copying Shulk, Kirby gets a his own Monado that he can use to utilise the same Monado Arts Shulk is able to use.

== In ''Super Mario Maker'' ==
In ''[[w:c:mario:Super Mario Maker|Super Mario Maker]]'', when Mario uses Shulk's Mystery Mushroom costume, pressing up on the controller will make Shulk hold up the Monado. 

== Notes ==
* When Dunban wields the Monado, it has an [[Attack]] of 200 - 280. In addition, during the [[Battle of Sword Valley]] it has [[Physical Defence]] 80, [[Ether Defence]] 90, and an [[Unbeatable]] 100% gem. Dunban also uses Monado Buster in a perpendicular manner as opposed to a straight line when Shulk uses it.
* When Shulk reaches [[Level (XC1)|level]] 90, the Monado's minimum and maximum Attack values both reach the maximum of 999. At this point [[Attack Stability]] gems will have no effect unless paired with an [[Attack Plus]] gem.

== Etymology == 
* The name Monado is likely derived from [[wikipedia:Gnosticism|Gnosticism]], in which the [[wikipedia:Monad (Gnosticism)|Monad]] is the Supreme Being, the highest god that created lesser gods or divine entities. Gnostic references have been a recurring theme throughout [[Tetsuya Takahashi]]'s works, including ''Xenogears'' and ''Xenosaga''.
* The Gnostic concept in turn was inspired by Greek philosophy. Pythagoreans called the first thing that came into existence "[[wikipedia:Monad (philosophy)|monad]]", which begat the dyad, which begat numbers, points, lines, etc. It meant the first being or the totality of all beings.

== Trivia == 
* ''Xenoblade'' was originally advertised as ''Monado: Beginning of the World''. The game was given its final name in January, 2010.
* Despite the game's lore saying the Monado cannot harm anything born of Bionis, in gameplay it has no difficulty harming any of the monsters that inhabit Bionis, including humanoids like [[Chilkin]]s, [[Hode]]s, [[Igna]]s, [[Kromar]]s, and [[Tirkin]]s. However, when Shulk's party is attacked by the Metal Face in Colony 9 and Xord in the Ether Mine, the High Entia assassins in Alcamoth and Tyrea in the High Entia Tomb, Shulk's attacks will bounce off their bodies. This restriction will be latter removed by Zanza which allows the Monado II to harm anything born in Bionis and Face Mechon.
* In various cutscenes throughout the game, the Monado displays the Japanese kanji that corresponds to what it is capable of destroying. The initial Monado displays the kanji for "Machine." The Monado II displays the kanji for "Person." The Monado III displays the kanji for "God."
* Each art of the Monado shows a different colour of the blade of light when used. This trait is also present with the [[Monado Replica EX+|Monado REX+]].
** Buster: Blue
** Enchant: Violet
** Shield: Yellow
** Speed: Light blue
** Purge: Green
** Armor: Orange
** Cyclone: White
** Eater: Black
** Rage: Red
* The powers of the Monado are similar to those of the [[w:c:Xenosaga:Zohar|Zohar]], an object that was present in both ''[[w:c:Xenosaga:Xenogears|Xenogears]]'' and ''[[w:c:Xenosaga:Xenosaga|Xenosaga]]''. The explanation Alvis gives about the origin of the Monado suggest that he has similar capabilities to the Zohar.
* The Monado's shift from red to white/teal is also seen in the evolution of Weltall in ''Xenogears'' and the Aegis sword in {{XC2|-}}.
* In {{XCDE|sub}}, the saturation and brightness changes on the models cause the Replica Dogma and Replica Rudra's colours to closely match the colour schemes of [[Elma]] and Malos, respectively.
* In {{XC2|-}}, every Monado Art symbol from {{XC|-}} can be seen during gameplay (except Enchant). The symbols for Purge, Cyclone, and Buster appear when Shulk uses them as his Blade Specials, the symbol for Speed appears during Shulk's Level IV Special, Monado Unbound, the symbol for Shield appears when Rex or Zeke use their [[Battle Arts (XC2)|Driver Art]] of the same name, and the symbols for Armor, Buster, Cyclone, and Eater appear on Malos's Aegis Sword when he uses them, but are slightly different. Additionally, every Monado Symbol seen in {{XC|-}}, plus the symbol for [[Monado Rage|Rage]], is present within {{XC2|-}}'s files, including the original versions of the symbols displayed on Malos's [[Aegis|Aegis Sword]].

'''Monica Vandham''' is a character in {{XC3}}. She is simply named '''Monica''' as a [[Hero]] or an NPC.

== Overview ==
Monica can be recruited as a Hero after completing [[Hero Quest]] ''[[Vandham's Heir]]''. She is the daughter of [[Guernica Vandham]] and the leader of the [[Lost Numbers]].

To get Monica to [[Class Rank (XC3)|Rank]] 20, a member of the party must reach rank 10 with the Lost Vanguard class and the quest ''[[Promise to the Future]]'' will be available in The City.

== Story ==
The daughter of Guernica Vandham and mother of [[Ghondor]], Monica is an Elder of the [[City]].

== Gameplay ==
Monica's class is a [[Defender (XC3)|Defender]] [[Class (XC3)|class]] named [[Lost Vanguard]]. Her [[Battle Arts (XC3)|Chain Art]] is [[Lost Advent]], and her Heroic Chain bonus will reactivate the character with the most [[Tactical Points|TP]] and give them 15 TP on top of that if she completes a Chain Order.

=== Base Stats ===
These are Monica's raw stats prior to modifications by class. They serve as a baseline for calculating her stats in the Lost Vanguard class (see its page for the corresponding multipliers which adjust these stats). Intermediate values are linearly interpolated between these base stats.
{| class="xc1 centered" width="80%"
! Level !! HP !! Attack !! Healing Power !! Dexterity !! Agility
|-
| 1 || 548 || 27 || 24 || 31 || 20
|-
| 99 || 7,833 || 382 || 341 || 307 || 200
|}
=== General Stats ===
These stats assume Monica is at rank 20 in her class. Stat increases from gems are shown separately from the base stat, and may not fully apply if Monica has not unlocked the corresponding gem slots.
{| class="xc1 centered" width="100%"
! Level !! HP !! Attack
! Healing Power !! Dexterity !! Agility !! Critical Rate !! Block Rate !! Physical Defense !! Ether Defense
|-
| 1, base||685 (+100)||38||8||37||18||10%||30%||50%||35%
|-
| 99, base||9,791 (+1,500)||824||119||368||180||20%||40%||50%||35%
|-
| 99, with default accessories||12,238 (+1,500)||824||119||368||180||20%||40%||65%||35%
|}

Monica equips the following gems:
* [[Ironclad]]
* [[Ultimate Counter]], at level 20 onwards
* [[Perilous Presence]], at level 40 onwards

Monica equips the following accessories as her default accessories, which can be changed in post-game or [[New Game + (XC3)|New Game+]]. All equipped accessories assume their Common variant.
* [[Soldier's Headband]]
* [[Iron Temple Guard]], at level 30 onwards
* [[Berserker's Armor Vest]], at level 50 onwards
