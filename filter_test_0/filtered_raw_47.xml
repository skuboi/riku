{{quote|An endless field of green among the clouds, eh? If the legends are true, even people like me...|Nia}}
'''Nia''' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|&#12491;&#12450;}}, ''Nia'', '''Niyah''') is one of the main playable characters in {{XC2}}. She is a [[Gormotti]] [[Driver]] and is accompanied by her [[Blade (XC2)|Blade]], [[Dromarch]], who calls her "Lady" ({{lang|ja|&#12362;&#23330;&#27096;}}, ''Oj&#333;sama'') like a butler. She comes from [[Gormott Province]]. Originally a member of [[Torna (Organization)|Torna]], she defects to [[Rex]]'s side after [[Pyra]]'s awakening.
__TOC__

== Personality ==
Nia usually comes across as sarcastic and cynical, always having a witty put-down at other characters' shortcomings. She is initially unfriendly and dismissive of Rex, particularly due to his belief in [[Elysium]] which she sees as childish naivety. She has a good political understanding of the annexing of Gormott by the [[Empire of Mor Ardain]], and opts to save lives where possible in opposition to the other members of Torna. She displays empathy for Pyra's situation and develops a teasing camaraderie with the rest of the party, warming especially to Rex as she gets to know him better.

As the Queen of [[Agnus]], Nia attempts to conceal her blunt and uncouth attitude with an air of refinement under the impression that her usual self would be considered undignified, but she has little success in doing so.

== Appearance ==
=== In {{XC2|-}} ===
Nia's Driver form is that of a young Gormotti girl with neck-length silver hair styled into a bob cut with matching feline ears on top of her head. She has amber eyes, three white stripe tattoos on her face, and elongated canine teeth. She is quite short and has a petite frame. She wears a feline-hooded yellow one-piece jumpsuit with gold-trimmed white armor plates around her chest and upper arms, and wears a brown utility belt around her hips with three daggers. She wears red and white heeled boots which come up at the top into large decorated white and black cones, which extend past her knees around the front and around her calves from the back.

As a Blade, Nia drops her feline mannerisms and appears more visually similar to a kitsune. She retains her facial markings, eyes, and elongated canines from her Driver form. Her hair now comes down to her legs and is styled into very low twintails tied up with red [[:wikipedia:Shimenawa|shimenawa-like rope]]. Her ears are now much longer, point upwards and outwards, and are decorated around the base. Her clothing resembles a [[:wikipedia:Miko|miko outfit]], which consists of a white gold-and-red trimmed leotard, with her [[Core Crystal]] - shaped like an upside down blue [[:wikipedia:Kite (geometry)|geometric kite]] with red blotches from being a Flesh Eater - visible on her chest, and matching large detached sleeves with white gloves. Both the leotard and sleeves are adorned with red rope with the former decorated with gold-colored bells. Her boots are now red with large gold spikes on the toe caps, with gold-trimmed white thigh-high leggings. Her default Catalyst Scimitar is a long blue blade with flowers running along it, with a guarded golden hilt.

=== In {{XC3|-}} ===
[[File:Meeting Queen Nia Xenoblade Chronicles 3 1-47 screenshot.png|alt=Nia as the Queen of Agnus|thumb|180px|Nia as the Queen of Agnus]]
As the Queen of Agnus, Nia wears long, hooded white robes with red accents resembling a kimono, with a large white bow on the back. Her dress is decorated with various golden accessories reminiscent of her Blade form. Her hair is now shorter coming down only to her shoulders. She retains her long pointed ears which are now attached to a white crown with golden accents and three light blue jewels coming down the front. Her crimson and aqua diamond Core Crystal is visible on her chest. While she retains most of her facial features, her eyes are distinctly more pointed.
{{clr}}

[[File:Hero Nia Xenoblade Chronicles 3.png|alt=Nia in her Hero outfit|left|thumb|180px|Nia in her Hero outfit]]
As a Hero, Nia wears a short yellow dress with a black belt around her waist, resembling her original Driver form. Nia also wears similar shoes and wrist guards and a slightly modified version of her original chest plate and spaulders. The back of her outfit is lined with white cloth with golden accents, with 2 pieces coming down toward her legs resembling her Blade form. Below her dress, she wears black leggings with a white band around her right thigh, reminiscent of [[Massive Melee Mythra]]. She wields a longer, curved version of her Catalyst Scimitar as well as two apparitions of Pyra's and [[Mythra]]'s Aegis Swords floating behind her. This combination is now referred to as the Anima Sword in game.

== Story ==
=== {{XC2|-}} ===
==== Becoming a Flesh Eater ====
{{Quote|Her life is tied to yours.|Nia's Father}}
[[File:NiaDromarch.png|thumb|left|Nia resonates with Dromarch]]
Nia was the Blade of the wealthy lord of Echell in [[Gormott Province]], who had a daughter, Nia's "sister," who was very frail and sickly. Nia studied to be a lady, until her [[Driver]] spent all of their money in search for a cure for his daughter and lost his status as a lord. The family became drifters, and the harsher lifestyle took a toll on the lord's daughter, who died not long afterwards. The lord made Nia consume his daughter's body, and Nia became a [[Flesh Eater]] and began addressing the lord as her "father."

[[File:NiaRecuit.png|thumb|right|Nia is rescued by Jin]]
Soon after the death of her sister, Nia's Driver passed away as well, and Nia found a [[Core Crystal]] of his and resonated with it, bonding her to [[Dromarch]]. The two began wandering around [[Alrest]]. Her status as a Flesh Eater caused the [[Indoline Praetorium]] to hunt them down, and the two were captured. [[Jin]] manages to free them, leading Nia to join him and the rest of Torna.

==== Meeting Rex ====
Nia meets Rex after she, Jin, and [[Malos]] go to [[Argentum Trade Guild]] to find help in salvaging a [[Ancient Ship|sunken ship]]. She initially shows skepticism at Rex's dream of finding [[Elysium]], but is nonetheless horrified when Jin kills Rex, which leaves her hesitant to continue to associate with Torna. This causes her to get caught in the [[Monoceros (XC2)|Monoceros]]' attack on the sunken ship, though [[Azurda]] manages to save both Rex and Nia in time.

[[File:NiaFight.png|thumb|left|Nia fights alongside Rex]]
Rex and Nia crash land on [[Gormott (Titan)|Gormott]], where they eventually make their way to [[Torigoth]]. Upon arrival, several soldiers from the [[Empire of Mor Ardain]] see them and attempt to apprehend them with the help of [[Brighid]]. Though Rex and Pyra are able to escape, Nia and Dromarch are captured. [[M&#242;rag]] later uses Nia as bait to lure Rex and Pyra into a trap, though the four escape. Nia attempts to part ways afterwards, but Rex's conviction in his goal convinces her to stay. 

In Uraya, the party encounter Akhos and Obrona, who taunt Nia for switching sides. After their defeat she talks about her time in Torna. Later Akhos and Malos fight [[Vandham (XC2)|Vandham]] and Nia considers healing him, but is too afraid to use her power. 

After the incident in [[Temperantia]], the [[Empire of Mor Ardain]] and the [[Kingdom of Uraya]] have a summit where [[Bana (XC2)|Bana]] attempts to kill everyone present with an explosive device. Emperor [[Niall]] nearly sacrifices himself to save the others, but Nia is able to revive him after asking Dromarch to distract the rest of the party so they do not see her powers.

==== Burdened No Longer ====
[[File:NiaBlade.png|thumb|right|Nia reveals her true form]]
As the group ventures through [[Spirit Crucible Elpys]], she begins showing signs of fatigue, similar to the Blades and [[Zeke]]. She begins sharing stories of her past, and Rex tells her to stay true to herself. Nia finally reveals herself as a Flesh Eater in the [[Vault of Heroes]] when the party is overwhelmed by [[Phantasm]]s. She thanks Rex for helping her see that she should not be afraid of who she is, and proclaims that she is free of her past, and of Jin. Nia confesses that she loves Rex for helping her find this freedom, to which he replies that he loves her and all of his friends, and they team up as Driver and Blade. Together, they fight the Phantasms until the voice of [[Addam]] himself tells them that Rex is the one who he has been waiting for to wield the true Aegis.

Nia fights as Rex's Blade as they travel to the [[Cliffs of Morytha]] to rescue Pyra. Malos meets the party in [[Balquors Ruins]] and taunts Nia for deciding to reveal her true nature having betrayed Torna, and uses his revived Aegis powers to attack the party. Nia explains that Malos' power is to destroy all he touches, but that hers is to restore - which she does, much to Malos' annoyance. Eventually she turns on him and uses her ability to make his cells replicate at an incredible rate, like a very fast-acting cancer, which debilitates him enough that he falls from the ruins and is assumed dead. Upon reaching the [[Gotrock Oracle Ruins]], the party tries to fight Jin and Malos, but are quickly overpowered by the duo, with Jin even nullifying Nia's healing powers. However, the tables turn upon Pyra's transformation into [[Pneuma]] and Rex easily defeats Jin. After a clash between [[Siren]] and [[Artifice Ophion|Ophion]], the ruins collapse and the party falls into the [[Land of Morytha]], with Rex, Mythra, Azurda, Poppi, and Brighid getting separated from the group. 

==== Climbing the World Tree ====
After the party reunites, they begin to climb up the [[World Tree]]. During the climb, Nia asks the other Blades in the group if they ever wanted to live after the deaths of their Drivers. She states that as a Flesh Eater, she has no knowledge of how long she will live. Later, the party encounters Amalthus in his Blade Eater form. During the battle, Rex fights Amalthus with both Pneuma's Aegis Sword and Nia's Catalyst Scimitar to counter some of his attacks while Nia provides healing for the group and fights alongside Dromarch. After Jin freezes Amalthus in place, he tells Nia to heal Rex and Mythra. In response, Nia asks him why he didn't kill her for siding with Rex, to which he answers that he recognized that Nia would become the Blade of someone she trusted, just like he did with [[Lora]]. Nia and the rest of the party then mourn Jin after he sacrifices himself to kill Amalthus.

==== Learning of Alrest's Creation ====
[[File:Nia title screen.png|thumb|left|Nia on the title screen]]
After the party finally reaches Elysium in the [[First Low Orbit Station]] and enter the [[Old Temple]], the party is separated by the [[Architect]]. Rex is manipulated into fighting specters of his friends; Nia and Dromarch's confront him about him loving Pyra instead of Nia, and he flees from them in hurt and confusion. After the Architect ends the visions, the party is brought back together and they all meet [[Klaus]], who tells them about the [[Conduit]] and how Alrest came to be as well as his [[Zanza|other half]]'s imminent death, before confronting Malos in the [[Aion Hangar]].

After Malos' death, the party runs to escape from the station as it begins to collapse. When Pneuma tells Rex to leave her behind so she can save Alrest, Nia helps comfort Rex as he pleads Pneuma not to, until he eventually accepts her decision. The party escapes on an escape pod, which breaks apart upon entry. Azurda, transforming into his adult form thanks to Pneuma's preparations, catches everyone and flies them to a landmass that all the Titans are combining with. Upon Pyra and Mythra's revival, Nia gives Rex encouragement to go to them, having made her peace with his decision.

[[File:XB3Endingphotoofxb2cast.png|thumb|Nia with a baby in a group photo]]
At some point, Nia is viewed with her child in a group photograph.

==== Nia and Melia's Plan ====
A few decades after Malos' defeat, the two worlds that Klaus created by splitting the original apart with the Conduit began to re-fuse back together, which would effectively destroy both. Making contact with [[Melia]] in the world of the [[Bionis]] as their worlds drew nearer to one another, she helped devise a plan that would allow their worlds to survive. Both worlds would construct one half of an ark known as [[Origin]] that contained all of their societies' knowledge and their citizens' literal souls, which would allow them to be reborn after their worlds were split apart and returned to their original forms. The core of [[Ontos]] was a critical part of its construction.

[[File:Nia&amp;Melia.jpg|thumb|Nia communicates with Melia|left]]
Unfortunately, the Origin system became corrupted by the desires for safety and security held by the souls it contained, creating an entity called [[Z]]. It hijacked the whole separation process between the world, and instead of being divided both worlds were frozen in time and a [[Aionios|third one]] was created between them to create a world without a "future". Nia would escape Z and enter cryogenic sleep, preparing the [[Ouroboros]] Stones using what little energy from Origin she still had access to and her own Core Crystal. She then entrusted the key to her [[Cloudkeep|hideaway]] to the renegade [[Consul]] [[M]], who hated her immortal state and wished to help Nia, trusting that people would be able to defy Z in the future and free her along with Melia. [[Poppi &#945;|Poppi]], who had escaped with Nia, entered a supercomputer near Nia's resting place, but she was still connected to Nia and the outside world through the computer and could use it to inform her of current events. The people of both worlds, meanwhile, were recreated in this new world but had been completely taken over by Z and its Consuls using a [[Queen of Agnus|robotic double]] of her as a puppet ruler. Under Z's rule, [[Agnus]] would wage a perpetual war with [[Keves]], effectively keeping the world in "a state of 'now'".

==== Reawakening ====
[[File:Nia Overseeing Origin.jpg|thumb|Nia overseeing Origin's construction]]
After the party liberates [[Agnus Castle]], [[Mio]], thanks to M's memories, leads the party to the [[Cloudkeep]] on [[Captocorn Peak]] in order to meet with Nia. However, as Nia begins to awaken, she is suddenly attacked by Moebius [[D]] and [[J]]. Fortunately, their attack is not fatal on account of stabbing her heart rather than her Core Crystal, and she later regains consciousness after the [[Moebius D &amp; J|two Moebius]] are defeated.

Upon awakening and introducing herself, Nia tells the party the story of how Aionios was created and about Origin. She also gives them a piece of [[Origin Metal]] needed to get to Origin and reveals that Melia is being held captive within Origin itself.

==== Nia's Memories ====
During the post-game, which takes place before the final boss battle, the party returns to the [[Hall of the Serene]] in the Cloudkeep to find Nia wearing a different outfit reminiscent of her Driver outfit. Upon realizing the presence of Ouroboros, Nia requests to join the party on their travels (unconvincingly insisting that it is in no way because she finds being a queen lonely and boring). She tells them that during their travels, she will tell them more about Alrest.

[[File:Nia Decides to Explore Aionios.jpg|thumb|Nia deciding to join the party]]
At the memorial of the first-generation [[Ouroboros]] in the [[City]], Nia speaks with Mio about the unusually close connection she felt with her (the further explanation of which is interrupted before she can fully clarify). When visiting her castle, she meets with [[Ghondor]] and tells her and the party about how important the "Vandham" name is to her, telling them about some of her experiences with the [[Vandham (XC2)|Vandham she knew]]. At [[Saffronia Tree|a Saffronia tree]] in the [[Rae-Bel Tableland]], Nia tells the party that Saffronias like that are originally from Alrest, and how much of Aionios' terrain originates from Alrest, such as how originally, the Urayan Mountains weren't as "picturesque" in the past. In the [[Archaic Tower]] in the [[High Maktha Wildwood]], Nia tells the party about how the original world was split in two in the first place. She explains how the people in that era fought each other over the absolute power of the Conduit, which led to that power ripping the world apart. She concludes the story by stating that the true meaning of ruins they are looking at, being the [[Land of Morytha]], is the stand as a monument to the history that created the world. Additionally, Nia reflects on how the people of the original world destroyed themselves; they too feared the prospect of coming to an end, and pursued the same "eternity" that Z now wishes to impose upon Aionios. 

During Nia's [[Hero Quest|Ascension Quest]], ''[[Grasping My Future]]'', the party brings her to the [[The Cavity]] of [[Swordmarch]] after she requests to go somewhere that is close enough to the sky. When they arrive, Nia admits that she wished to make a new memory with them despite not knowing if she would even be able to remember anything about Bionis or Aionios following the separation of the worlds. She questions her own place in the world, as she considers herself a relic from a bygone era, but Mio manages to convince her to continue to be a part of their future in whatever form it might take after the two worlds have split again.

==== Escaping the "Endless Now" ====
During Noah and his allies' final battle against [[Z&#8734;]], Nia and Melia launch an assault onto Origin using their Castles as [[Ferronis]] and provide support to the party by summoning the allies of the party to help them fight [[X&#8734;]] and [[Y&#8734;]]. After the party regroups, Nia and Melia arrive to join the fight themselves. After Z's defeat, Nia and Melia appear to ask the party if their decision to separate the two worlds is final. As the two Queens make their preparations, Nia remarks that although their worlds will become separated for a time, she believes the day will come when they get to walk hand-in-hand again. Back in the Cloudkeep, she is joined by Poppi, who exits from the supercomputer, as she glances at a framed photograph of her friends and family back in Alrest, stating that she will see them soon as the worlds of Alrest and the Bionis are reconstructed.

== In {{XC3|-}} ==
In {{XC3}}, Nia can be recruited as a [[Hero]] by traveling to the [[Hall of the Serene]] of the [[Cloudkeep]] on [[Captocorn Peak]] after completing the game, or in [[New Game + (XC3)|New Game +]]. She uses the [[Lifesage]] [[Class (XC3)|class]], a [[Healer]] class that wields the [[Blade (XC3)|Anima Sword]], which consists of Nia's Catalyst Scimitar as well as watery apparitions of Pyra and Mythra's [[Aegis|Aegis Swords]] that float behind her. By completing her [[Hero Quest|Ascension Quest]] ''[[Grasping My Future]]'', Nia's [[Class Rank (XC3)|rank]] as a Lifesage will increase from 10 to 20. Her unique theme, [[Drifting Soul|Kaleidoscopic Core]], plays when she is used in battle if the "Special BGM" setting is enabled.

=== Arts ===
* '''[[Divine Sword (XC3)|Divine Sword]]''' ([[Battle Arts (XC3)|Talent Art]]), Heal all on hit/Pierce
* '''[[Saber Slash (XC3)|Saber Slash]]''', Area heal on hit
* '''[[Redemption (XC3)|Redemption]]''', AOE / Heal
* '''[[Redeeming Bloom]]''', Field / Regenerate
* '''[[Last Hope]]''', Blowdown / Pierce
* '''[[Merciful Heart]]''', AOE / Knockback

Nia's Chain Art is [[Salvation's Ripple]], which gives a X% chance to revive all downed party members, where X increases with level, allowing them to participate in the [[Chain Attack (XC3)|Chain Attack]], and her Heroic Chain bonus will reactivate all characters apart from herself when she completes a Chain Order.

=== Class Skills ===
* '''Steadfast Feelings''', Restores nearby allies' HP on Art execution. Amount healed is equal to 35-50% of user's Healing
* '''Instant Regen+''', 25% chance to heal using 70-100% Healing Power upon taking damage.
* '''Enhanced Cellular Stimulus''', 35-50% chance on hit to deal 125-200% of Healing Power as defense-bypassing damage.
* '''Abundant Oceans''', Reduces damage to allies by 11-15%, and boosts HP recovery by 11-15% (does not stack).

=== Base Stats ===
These are Nia's raw stats prior to modifications by class. They serve as a baseline for calculating her stats in the Lifesage class (see its page for the corresponding multipliers which adjust these stats). Intermediate values are linearly interpolated between these base stats.
{| class="xc1 centered" width="80%"
! Level !! HP !! Attack !! Healing Power !! Dexterity !! Agility
|-
| 1 || 488 || 27 || 28 || 33 || 22
|-
| 99 || 6,972 || 385 || 403 || 326 || 220
|}

=== General Stats ===
These stats assume Nia is at rank 20 in her class. Stat increases from gems are shown separately from the base stat, and may not fully apply if Nia has not unlocked the corresponding gem slots.
{| class="xc1 centered" width="100%"
! Level !! HP !! Attack

|-
|99||4,531||847 (+70)||523 (+45)||391||242||20%||30%||15%||25%

Nia equips the following [[Gem]]s:
* [[Doublestrike]]
* [[Steelcleaver]], at level 20 onwards
* [[Lifebearer]], at level 40 onwards

== In {{SSBU|-}} ==
Nia is one of the characters who can appear on the {{SSBU}} DLC stage, Cloud Sea of Alrest, where she may be present in the background alongside Dromarch. There is also a Nia costume available for Mii Fighters. Nia also has a Spirit that can be unlocked on the Spirit Board. Her spirit is represented by a Mii Brawler wearing her costume, assisted by an Incineroar puppet fighter, which heals over time. When equipped, her spirit grants a bonus to the water attacks used by Squirtle, Greninja and Corrin. Additionally, one of Mythra's palette swaps is based on Nia, which is paired with Pyra's color option that is based on her [[Disguised Pyra|Gormotti Disguise]].

== Merchandise ==
[[File:Nia final figure.jpg|thumb|120px|1/7 Scale Nia figurine revealed at WonHobby 34]]

== Trivia ==
* After completing [[New Game Plus (XC2)|New Game Plus]], Nia joins with Rex, Pyra, and Mythra on the title screen, joining their chain of linked hands.
* There were several hints in {{XC2|-}} telling that Nia is a Blade before being actually revealed.
** She gasped in shock when Cole revealed he is a Flesh Eater.
** When Nia, Poppi and Mythra were taking a bath, Mythra was surprised when she looked at Nia's chest and agreed to keep "it" a secret.
** Near the end of Chapter 6, it was revealed that Torna, the organization she used to work for, consists ''entirely'' of Blades.
* Nia, [[Melia]], [[Riku]] &amp; [[Manana]] are the only non-DLC Heroes in {{XC3|-}} that can never be fought by the party.
[[File:Mio Nia Outfit.png|thumb|120px|Mio's outfit]]
* In {{XC3|-}}'s [[Challenge Battle Mode]], Mio can obtain an [[Clothing|outfit]] based on Nia's Blade form from {{XC2|-}}.

'''No. 13''' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|&#12491;&#12468;}}, ''Nii Gou'', ''Number 2'') is a character in {{XC3}}. She is a former member of [[Colony 0]].

== Overview ==
No. 13 was the former leader of Colony 0 and its best pilot, prior to going missing on a mission. After being stranded, she learned to survive for herself, leading her to realizing that she didn't need to follow orders anymore, and gained a twisted joy from bringing pain to others. She was very close with [[Segiri]], and her appearance is near identical, with the exception of her bangs being on the opposite side, being slightly taller, and having a slightly darker hair color. She has a sense similar to telepathy which allows her to detect Segiri's lifeforce.

== Trivia ==
* Given the history of encountering No.13, No.7 &amp; 13 were indirectly referred to as siblings, even possibly twins.
** Appropriately, they have opposite numbers: 13, the misfortune &amp; 7, the lucky. Together they add up to 20, the rebirth. Which also means from the plot point of view that Segeri reaches Rank 20 after seeing No. 13 again.

{{quote|If the world holds our lives back, I will end it! It's as simple as that!|Noah}}
'''Noah''' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|&#12494;&#12450;}}, ''Noa'') is a playable character and, along with [[Mio]], a protagonist of {{XC3}}.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Xenoblade-Chronicles-3-2168340.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Overview ==
Noah is a [[Keves]]i soldier and an [[off-seer]]. Along with his friends [[Lanz]] and [[Eunie]], he is assigned to [[Colony 9 (XC3)|Colony 9]]. He is a Kevesi human with [[Homs]] traits who, despite his slim physique, has impressive physical power.

== Personality ==
Even from an early age, Noah questioned the nature of [[Aionios]] and the war and often expressed discontent with the pointlessness of the conflict he was compelled to participate in. While brave and willing to risk his life for the sake of his friends and for his ideal of a world where nobody will need to fight just to survive, he is fundamentally kindhearted and dislikes having to fight others unless he has no choice. However, his kindness still has its limits and and he will show no mercy to those who commit especially grave personal offenses against him or his allies.

Noah takes his role as an Off-Seer very seriously to the point where he insists on sending on Agnians as well as Kevesi. Despite having fought against Agnus all his life, he bears the Agnians no ill will himself. Upon learning of Moebius and their role as the instigators of the war, he came to hate them for the way they viewed the lives of others as little more than playthings.  

== Story ==
=== Previous Lives ===
[[File:Opening Noah.png|thumb|The original Noah races to see the fireworks]]
Prior to the merging of the two worlds and the creation of [[Aionios]], the original Noah was a young boy who lived on a town on the [[Bionis]] with his friends Lanz, Eunie and [[Joran]]. On the day of the [[Melia|Queen]]'s anniversary, Noah and his friends raced to see the fireworks in Alcamoth but Noah soon found time standing still as the two worlds collided with one another. As part of the [[Origin]] system, Noah and his friends would be reborn in Aionios as soldiers of Keves. One incarnation of him would seek to end the cycle of war with his lover [[Mio]], but ultimately failed and gave into his despair, leading him to accept [[Z]]'s offer to become a [[Consul]]. Through some strange accident, this incarnation's hopes and ideals managed to be reborn once more as "Noah" while his regret coalesced into the Consul [[N]]. 

=== Early Terms ===
An unknown amount of time later, an incarnation of Noah was reborn and assigned to [[Colony 14]] along with his friends from his previous life. As young soldiers of Keves, Noah and his squad would train alongside [[Garvel]]'s squad, with whom they developed an ongoing rivalry. Noah was bullied by Garvel and his friends for being unable to call his Blade but a visit to [[Riku]] revealed that Noah could indeed call his Blade but chose not to as he feared what he might become through fighting. Noticing young Noah's kindhearted nature, Riku offered him the unbreakable sword [[Lucky Seven]]. Noah initially refused Riku's offer, fearing the destruction he may cause with such a weapon but after some convincing he decided to keep the blade, hiding it within his Blade as a sheath.

During a [[Homecoming Ceremony]] at Colony 14, Noah was inspired to become an Off-Seer after watching [[Crys]]. The two of them would later meet in person at [[Keves Castle]] where Crys decided to take on Noah as his student. 

At some point, Noah, along with Eunie, Lanz, and Riku, were transferred to [[Colony 9 (XC3)|Colony 9]], where they were grouped with [[Mwamba]].

=== Becoming Ouroboros ===
After a victorious battle against [[Colony Sigma]], Noah, Lanz, and Eunie are given a special mission to intercept a mysterious airship in [[Alfeto Valley]]. However, when they reach the area, they also encounter Agnus forces which sparks a battle. Noah and his team arrive at the airship's [[Gura Flava Lowlands|crash site]] at the same time as Mio, [[Sena]], and [[Taion]]. As they battle, the airship's sole survivor, [[Guernica Vandham]], intervenes and stops the fighting, claiming he knows their "true enemy". However, he is shot by a [[Moebius D &amp; J|Moebius]], who, after killing both Mwamba and [[Hackt]], attacks Noah and Mio's teams and quickly gains the upper hand until Guernica activates the [[Ouroboros Stone]] he was smuggling, imbuing Noah and Mio's teams with its power and making them [[Ouroboros]]. Noah and Mio then inadvertently [[Interlink]], forcing the Moebius to retreat, and a mortally wounded Guernica instructs the party to head for the [[City]] at [[Swordmarch]] where they can find answers. Noah and his team then attempt to return to Colony 9, but are attacked by their former comrades, who have been manipulated by Moebius to see them as enemies. They decided to return to the crash site, where they decided to work together with Mio and her team.

== Gameplay ==
Noah's initial [[Class (XC3)|class]] is [[Swordfighter]], and wields a bright red blade, known as the [[Blade (XC3)|Veiled Sword]]. It is similar to the weapons of previous protagonists in the {{XC|serieslink}}, such as [[Shulk]]'s [[Monado Replica EX]], and [[Rex]], the wielder of [[Pyra]]'s [[Aegis|Aegis Sword]]. Later on, Noah utilizes a special blade called [[Lucky Seven]] to gains access to three unique [[Battle Arts (XC3)|Talent Arts]], [[Infinity Blade (XC3)|Infinity Blade]], [[Unlimited Sword]], and [[Final Lucky Seven]].

In a [[Chain Attack (XC3)|Chain Attack]], Noah starts with 30 TP by default. His Chain Art is [[Brave Assault]], which grants a 60-100% chance (depending on his level) for hits in the Chain Attack to ignore defense.

Noah starts at Rank 5 in his initial Swordfighter class when in the player's party for the first time.
=== Base Stats ===
These are Noah's raw stats prior to modifications by class. They serve as a baseline for calculating Noah's stats in a class. Intermediate values are linearly interpolated between these base stats.
{| class="xc1 centered" width="80%"

=== General Stats ===
These stats assume Noah is at level 99, at rank 20 in each of these respective classes (except the [[Unlimited Sword]] classes, for which rank 20 cannot be attained), and is not equipping any [[Skill (XC3)|Master Skills]], [[Gem]]s or [[Accessory (XC3)|Accessories]]. Boosts from skills innate to a class are indicated with round brackets, whereas boosts from having an [[Blade Upgrade|upgraded Blade]] are indicated with square brackets.

After becoming Ouroboros, Noah is able to [[Interlink]] with [[Mio]]. When Noah is in control, he is able use arts that deal heavy damage.

Starting in Chapter 6, Noah gains access to the Ouroboros Talent Art [[Origin Blade]], which can weaken enemies. Origin Blade can be used if Noah Interlinks while using [[Lucky Seven]] or at Interlink Level 3 during the last portion of the Heat Gauge.

Noah's Ouroboros [[Chain Attack (XC3)|Chain Art]] is [[Limits Unbound]], which greatly increases damage ratio and deals defense-bypassing damage.

=== Skills ===
* '''Link Force''', Slightly/Greatly boosts damage dealt when an ally is down/has low HP.
* '''Satisfying Piercer''', On critical, ignore enemy defense. Also increases critical hit damage bonus by 30-50 percentage points.
* '''Omnipresent Blade''', Boosts damage dealt and Critical Rate by 10-20% on critical hit.
* '''Opportunity in Crisis''', Grants a small/large increase to damage dealt, based on heat gauge level.

An [[Amiibo]] of Noah was announced on April 18, 2023.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1648500990788915200?s=20]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clr}}

== Etymology ==
Noah in Hebrew (''&#1504;&#1493;&#1465;&#1495;&#1463;'') means "repose" or "rest". It is notably the name of [[wikipedia:Noah|Noah]], a biblical figure, who in Abrahamic tradition was the only man that God deemed to be good in a world of sinners. He was told to build a great craft to house two of each animal on Earth, so that they would not go extinct when God purged the world with a great flood, and weather the flood with his family. After the flood, he made an agreement with God on behalf of mankind that He would never flood the world again.

== Quotes ==
* ''"We've come this far harboring everyone's hopes and dreams! And so...! We would never stop now, not when we've come so far!"''
* ''"This...is the truth of our world. Memories melt in the morning light, and then, a new day begins. Roads stretch out before us. So many paths. Which do you choose? That's up to you. Sometimes, you might run astray. You'll stop, maybe cry in frustration. But, you know, that's all right. For the roads... They go on without end. So look up, face forward, toward your chosen horizon... And just... walk on."''

== Trivia ==
* Noah seems to be based on [[w:c:xenosaga:Fei Fong Wong|Fei Fong Wong]], the main protagonist of ''[[w:c:xenosaga:Xenogears|Xenogears]]''.
** Both of them have ponytails and were seeking to end wars.
** Both have been reincarnated many times.
** Noah meets Mio, his wife in previous lives, in a [[Alfeto Valley|forest-like area]] while Fei meets Elly in a [[w:c:xenosaga:Blackmoon Forest|forest]]. The two briefly work together in each game before being separated for a while, with the girl telling her they'd be enemies next time they meet but not going through with it when the time came.
** Noah's Ouroboros form is similar to Fei's [[w:c:xenosaga:Gear|gear]], [[w:c:xenosaga:Weltall|Weltall]].
** The climax where Noah relives his past lives and learns about how he "became" N is a nod to how Fei learns of his previous lives as well as the origins of [[w:c:xenosaga:Id|Id]] and [[w:c:xenosaga:Grahf|Grahf]].
** Furthermore, "Project '''Noah'''" was the working title for Xenogears at the beginning of its development. In the game itself, it refers to [[w:c:xenosaga:Karellen|Karellen's]] plan in creating his own god using [[w:c:xenosaga:Deus|Deus]].

{{Quote|Friends best show what friends capable of.|Nopon Archsage}}
The '''Nopon Archsage''' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|&#12494;&#12509;&#12531;&#12539;&#12480;&#12452;&#12475;&#12531;&#12491;&#12531;}}, ''Nopon daisen'nin'') is a recurring character in the {{XC|serieslink}}.

== {{XC2|-}} ==
In {{XC2}}, he is a [[Nopon]] who can be found at the [[Land of Challenge (XC2)|Land of Challenge]], available as downloadable content from the [[Xenoblade Chronicles 2#Challenge Battle Mode Pack|Challenge Battle Mode Pack]] of the Expansion Pass. Talking to him after his introduction cutscene allows the player to participate in [[Challenge Battle Mode|Challenge Battles]].

Upon first meeting him, he says that he built the Land of Challenge, and he is one-hundred million times the age of [[Tora (XC2)|Tora]], despite his young appearance similar to the [[Nopon Sage (XC1)|Nopon Sage]] in {{XC}}.

== {{XCDE|-}} ==
In {{XCDE}}, he is a Nopon found in the shrine of the Nopon Archsage who allows the player to participate in the mode [[Time Attack]]. He also offers various items in exchange for [[Noponstone]] obtained from Time Attack challenges.

== {{XC3|-}} ==
In {{XC3}}, he reprises his role as the overseer of the [[Challenge Battle Mode]] in the [[Land of Challenge (XC3)|Land of Challenge]], available as downloadable content from the [[Xenoblade Chronicles 3#Expansion Pass|Expansion Pass]]. 
{{clr}}

== Trivia ==
* The Nopon Archsage is the only character in {{XCDE|-}} (outside of {{XCFC|sublink}}) that was not in the [[Xenoblade Chronicles|original]] game.
* In the English version of {{XC2|-}}, the Nopon Archsage is voiced by Daniel Buckley, who also voices [[Niall]], as well as [[Hugo (TTGC)|Hugo]] in {{TTGC}}. In the Japanese version, he is voiced by Hitomi &#332;wada, who also voices [[Nia]].
* In the English version of {{XC3|-}}, the Nopon Archsage is voiced by Adam Howden, who also voices [[Shulk]] and [[Zanza]] in {{XC|-}}, as well as the [[Architect]] in {{XC2|-}}. In the Japanese version, he is voiced by Akio &#332;tsuka, who also voices [[Z]], as well as [[Bana (XC2)|Chairman Bana]] in {{XC2|-}}
* In {{TTGC}}, there is a character named the [[Nopon Halfsage]] whose model is a tiny version of that of the Nopon Archsage.
* If the Nopon Archsage is talked to while [[Jin]], [[Malos]], or [[Vandham (XC2)|Vandham]] is in the active party, the Nopon Archsage will not allow any Challenge Battles to be selected until the character is removed from the active party.

[[File:XC3 Noponic Champion Class Icon.png|thumb|The Noponic Champion class icon]]
'''Noponic Champion''' is a DLC [[Agnus|Agnian]] [[Defender (XC3)|Defender]] [[Class (XC3)|class]] in {{XC3}}.

== Overview ==
Noponic Champion is the class of [[Ino]]. The [[Blade (XC3)|Blades]] of the Noponic Champion class are known as the Inosabers. The class is unlocked upon completion of the DLC [[Hero Quest]] ''[[Champion of the Nopon]]'', which becomes accessible in Chapter 3 as long as the [[Xenoblade Chronicles 3#Expansion Pass|Expansion Pass]] has been purchased, with [[Noah]] being the class inheritor. The [[Class Rank (XC3)|Class Rank]] limit is increased from 10 to 20 upon completion of the Ascension Quest ''[[The Hope of Noponkind]]''.

The Noponic Champion class gains bonuses when evading attacks, rewarding effective use of evasion Arts. Additionally, it gains bonuses after being incapacitated, allowing the user to grow stronger in protracted battles where the likelihood of being incapacitated is high. Despite being classified as being part of the [[Nopon Caravans]], arts belonging to the Nopon Champion class function like those of Agnian classes.

== Class Stats ==
The Noponic Champion class grants the following multipliers to a character's base stats (see their individual pages for their base stats), and sets their Physical and Ether Defense to the following values, depending on their current Rank. Intermediate values are linearly interpolated between the minimum and maximum values, rounding to the nearest percent.
{| class="xc1 centered" width="100%"
! Rank !! HP !! Attack !! Healing Power !! Dexterity !! Agility !! Physical Defense !! Ether Defense
|-
| 1 || 110% || 85% || 0% || 110% || 120% || 35% || 30%
|-
| 10 || 115% || 90% || 0% || 115% || 125% || 40% || 35%
|-
| 20 || 120% || 95% || 0% || 120% || 130% || 45% || 40%
|}
=== Weapon Stats ===
The character's Attack stat after being modified by the above class stats is further modified by adding the class's weapon stat, which depends on the character's [[Level (XC3)|Level]], to obtain the final base Attack stat. These weapon stats also determine the character's Critical Rate and Block Rate. 

Characters temporarily assume these weapon stats to calculate relevant statistics when using a Master Art from this Class without it being part of a Fusion Art. If a Master Art is used in a Fusion Art, the weapon stats corresponding to the character's current Class will be used instead for calculations.&lt;!-- In the exercise of saving space, only every tenth level is displayed --&gt;
