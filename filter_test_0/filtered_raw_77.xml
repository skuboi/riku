They light up in the night air, making it easier to spot them from a distance. They are similar in size to [[Skeeter]]s and [[Flier]]s. All Wisps have the same appearance.

'''X''' (Japanese: &#12456;&#12483;&#12463;&#12473; ''Ekkusu'') is an antagonist in {{XC3}}. She is a member of Moebius.

== Overview ==
Alongside with [[Y]] and [[Z]], X is one of the original and first [[Consul]]s.

== Appearance ==
[[File:Consul X.jpg|left|thumb|240px|X when she is masked.]]
X has the appearance of a small girl with fair skin and white colored hair styled into a bob cut with long bangs that typically cover much of the right side of her face and eye. She has bright blood orange-colored eyes, with thick eyelashes. Similar to Y and Z, X has a purple scar across her face. In addition, she has a butterfly-like aura hair ornament on the left side of her head.

When she is wearing her Consul mask, X's helmet resembles the Latin letter 'X'.
{{clr}}

== Story ==
She is one of the original Moebius alongside Y, and Z. She can either be encountered first at [[Colony 5]] during ''[[Side Story: Eunie]]'', or at [[Agnus Castle]] during [[Chapter 5 (XC3)|Chapter 5]]. Although, she is first seen telling [[P]] and [[O]] that [[N]] wanted to see them, as he had an idea on how they could get rid of [[Ouroboros]], though they were unsuccessful.

During ''Side Story: Eunie'', she attacks Colony 5 alongside [[L]]. She explains to the party about the truth of the Colony ranking system, and that those who make it to Gold rank are killed.

During the main story, she is first seen using her staff to cancel the [[Interlink]] between [[Lanz]] and [[Sena]], preventing their suicide attack against N, he was actually surprised at her appearance but she said this was under [[Z]]'s orders. She is next seen during [[Mio]]'s [[Homecoming Ceremony]], though it was revealed afterwards [[M]] swapped her mind with Mio and sacrificed herself so she could live. After the party are freed from their bonds and beat N, she sends the [[Queen of Agnus (boss)|false Queen of Agnus]] to attack them. After the queen was defeated, X then activates the Castle's [[Annihilator]] to attack the [[City]], having gotten the location from [[Shania]], before fleeing. Although, also courtesy of M and Mio, the City was warned and moved.

She is last seen in [[Origin]], where she fights the party in her Moebius form, before being killed. A being known as [[X&#8734;]] that resembles X is also fought during the final battle against Z.

== Gameplay ==
[[file:Noah Mio Interlink.png|thumb|180px|Noah and Mio's Ouroboros]]
{{XC3|-}} uses a similar approach to gameplay mechanics as {{XC}}, {{XC2}} and {{XCX}}, such as the freedom to explore the world of [[Aionios]], the ability to run to virtually anywhere seen in the distance, and a semi-action-based battle system with the return of an [[Battle Arts (XC3)|Arts]] battle system which involves both [[Auto-Attack (XC3)|auto-attacks]] and a cooldown timer for each Art.

In this installment, soldiers of [[Keves]] and [[Agnus]] can materialize the weapons they utilize in battle, known as [[Blade (XC3)|Blades]], at will. Each soldier's Blade is a reflection of them, so they might take different forms such as swords, guns, shields, or spears. Moreover, three pairs of main playable characters can utilize the [[Interlink]] system during a battle to combine them into a larger form, called [[Ouroboros]], when certain conditions are met, making them significantly more powerful with special abilities. As the story progresses, the party will meet and be able to recruit a seventh party member during battle, called a [[Hero]], as a guest but not controllable character.
{{clr}}

[[File:XC3 Attacker Defender Healer.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Attacker, Defender and Healer system]]
The battle system brings a more strategic dimension with the [[Tactics]] system and [[Role]]s that are broadly classified into three categories: [[Attacker]], [[Defender (XC3)|Defender]], and [[Healer]]. Each of them has different abilities and skills. Attackers specialize in attacking and inflicting heavy damage from the enemy's flanks and back. However, their high attack power makes them vulnerable to enemy attacks, so it is important to be able to fight from an advantageous position while dodging enemy attacks. Healers specialize in healing the party. Additionally, only healers are able to revive incapacitated party members. Another strategic option is the [[Quick Move]] allowing the played character to temporarily retract and move a certain distance at high speed.

Similarly to {{TTGC}}, the character controlled by the player can be swapped with another while exploring the world. Additionally, unlike in {{TTGC|-}}, the player can switch between characters during battle.

'''X&#8734;''' is a [[Boss (XC3)|Boss]] in {{XC3}}. It is a [[Moebius]] fought at level 75 in [[Origin]]. During the battle, only [[Noah]], [[Lanz]], and [[Eunie]] will be usable. The equipped Hero may also be available during the battle, which will prevent that Hero from participating in the fight against [[Y&#8734;]]. This enemy is fought during the second phase of the final Boss fight against [[Z&#8734;]]. Several [[Hero]]es (except for [[Ino]] and [[Masha]]) are summoned by [[Melia]] and [[Nia]] to aid the party when X&#8734;'s HP depletes enough. Whenever the player uses a [[Battle Arts (XC3)|Talent Art]], a random Hero will follow up with their own Talent Art. Once defeated, the rest of the party will fight Y&#8734;.

'''Y''' is a character in {{XC3}}.

== Overview ==
Y is a [[Consul]] and the inventor of the [[Flame Clock]]s, this was his gift as an "Avatar" of [[Z]]. He oversees [[Colony Omega]] and uses its residents as test subjects for his deranged "research". Along with [[X]] and Z, he is one of the original Consuls. At some point, [[Mio]], [[Miyabi]], and [[Sena]] were assigned to his colony. One of his experiments went awry, killing most of the colony members leaving Mio, Sena, and unbeknownst to the former two, Miyabi as the sole three survivors.
{{clr}}

== Story ==
Y appears in Origin to discuss Ouroboros's progress. He later reappears after [[N]]'s defeat at the Agnian castle to declare his intent to take charge of the fight against Ouroboros.

He is one of the original Moebius alongside X and Z. He considered the Flame Clocks given to [[Ethel]] and [[Cammuravi]] one of his finest creations. 

Y is encountered at Colony Omega, [[Mio]] and [[Sena]]'s old colony, in ''[[Side Story: Mio]]'' during [[Chapter 6 (XC3)|Chapter 6]]. The violet Flame Clock he made is a special kind, it allowed him to revive [[Miyabi]], [[Mwamba]], [[Hackt]], and Cammuravi close to their [[Homecoming Ceremony]], but seemingly devoid of their memories. He made them fight against [[Ouroboros]] but seeing Miyabi playing her [[Flute|flute]], Mio and [[Noah]] decided to do the same, allowing the others fight. The music and [[Lucky Seven|sword of the end]] freed the four from Y's control and even restored their past memories. This made Y furious, and he turned into his Moebius form to attack Ouroboros, who say he is even "chunkier" than [[K]]. [[Taion]] immobilized him allowing Noah to destroy the Flame Clock. Y said he was impressed, he told them to spread their brilliance through the world, and he'd be watching eagerly before disappearing.

During ''[[Side Story: Lanz]]'', Y talks with [[H]] about her plans to attack the [[City]] telling her that the residents won't give her life due to not being connected to a Flame Clock. However, H told him will be using a special green one that Y was going to get rid of, he first called it lunacy but takes it back. Unfortunately for them, that Flame Clock was also destroyed and H herself was defeated.

Y is last seen at [[Defense Tower 4|Defense Tower #4]] in [[Origin]], where he stands as Z's last line of defense, fighting the party in his Moebius form, before being killed. A being known as [[Y&#8734;]] that resembles Y is also fought during the final battle against Z.

== Personality ==
Similar to other Moebius, Y is arrogant and views mortal lives as little more than food for Moebius or research subjects for his experiments. Y is fanatically reverent of Z, considering himself and the other Moebius to be extensions of Z's will. He is very level-headed and rarely loses his temper except for events that contradict his expectations, particularly when Ouroboros is able to override the established laws of life and death Z created.

Y is dedicated to improving Moebius's life and is fascinated at how strong a person's lifeforce can become in the moments prior to their demise. However, he is dismissive and unconcerned with memories and emotion, believing them to be external factors that get "tacked on" during life and free will to be an "undesirable side-effect" in his experiments. Y is nihilistic and believes life is devoid of any inherent meaning.
