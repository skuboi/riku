'''Accessories''' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|&#12450;&#12463;&#12475;&#12469;&#12522;&#12540;}}, ''Akusesar&#299;'') are a type of equipment in {{XC3}} and {{XC3FR|sublink}}.

== Overview ==
They are items worn by the six main characters and heroes that strengthen them in various ways, from increasing maximum [[Hit Points (XC3)|HP]], to healing on criticals, or increasing resistance to debuffs. They can be purchased from Accessory [[Shop (XC3)|Shops]], received as enemy drops, [[Craft Accessories|crafted]], or received as rewards from [[Quest (XC3)|Quests]] and [[Challenge Battle Mode]]. They are similar to [[Accessory (XC2)|Accessories]] in {{XC2}}, and compared to {{XC}} and {{XCX}}, the Accessory mechanic somewhat works like a mix of both [[armour]]/[[armor]] and [[Gem]]s/[[Augment]]s mechanics. 

All heroes are equipped with specific Accessories when first acquired, but these accessories cannot be altered until beating the game, or starting [[New Game + (XC3)|New Game +]]. Each character has three slots to equip accessories, though only one slot is available initially; the second and third slots are unlocked upon [[Level (XC3)|leveling up]] to levels 30 and 50 respectively.

Many accessories have a suggested role associated to them, which recommends them being equipped by characters assuming that role; sorting the accessories by "Recommended" will list all such accessories corresponding to the character's role first. However, there are no role restrictions on equipping accessories.

=== In {{XC3FR|sub}} ===
In {{XC3FR|sub}}, Accessory slots are unlocked through the use of [[Accessory Unlock Kit]]s, instead of automatically being unlocked after reaching a certain level.

Additionally, once [[W (FR)|Moebius W]] is defeated, all party members will obtain an additional accessory slot. This slot can only be used to equip Manuals, a type of accessory exclusive to {{XC3FR|sub}} that changes a character's Heroic Chain and/or Completion Bonus during a [[Chain Attack (XC3)|Chain Attack]]. Manuals cannot be equipped to the standard accessory slots.

== Types of Accessories ==
&lt;!-- The discussion on accessory names did not go very far, so for now I'll use the names for XC2 accessories, since they share the same sprite. Additionally, I don't seem to see any instance of cube accessories anywhere, so that sprite might end up unused - MagmaHound --&gt;
