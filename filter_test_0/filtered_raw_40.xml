== Class Stats ==
The Lost Vanguard class grants the following multipliers to a character's base stats (see their individual pages for their base stats), and sets their Physical and Ether Defense to the following values, depending on their current Rank. Intermediate values are linearly interpolated between the minimum and maximum values, rounding to the nearest percent.
{| class="xc1 centered" width="100%"
! Rank !! HP !! Attack !! Healing Power !! Dexterity !! Agility !! Physical Defense !! Ether Defense
|-
| 1 || 120% || 75% || 30% || 110% || 80% || 40% || 30%
|-
| 10 || 122% || 77% || 32% || 115% || 85% || 45% || 32%
|-
| 20 || 125% || 80% || 35% || 120% || 90% || 50% || 35%
|}
=== Weapon Stats ===
The character's Attack stat after being modified by the above class stats is further modified by adding the class's weapon stat, which depends on the character's [[Level (XC3)|Level]], to obtain the final base Attack stat. These weapon stats also determine the character's Critical Rate and Block Rate. 

Characters temporarily assume these weapon stats to calculate relevant statistics when using a Master Art from this Class without it being part of a Fusion Art. If a Master Art is used in a Fusion Art, the weapon stats corresponding to the character's current Class will be used instead for calculations.&lt;!-- In the exercise of saving space, only every tenth level is displayed --&gt;

{{Infobox Equipment
|name     = Lucky Seven
|image    = Lucky Seven.jpg
}}
'''Lucky Seven''', also known as '''Sword of The End''' and '''Sword of Origin''' is a special [[Blade (XC3)|Blade]] in {{XC3}} and {{XC3FR|sublink}}.

== Overview ==
It is a one-of-a-kind sword used by [[Noah]] that has the ability to cut through anything, and is one of the only things capable of destroying the [[Flame Clock]]s. The Blade's origins are tied directly to [[Aionios]] and [[Moebius]] itself.

== Characteristics ==
A katana-like weapon that was forged by [[Melia]], with "important people" residing inside the sword due to Origin metal's properties of retaining memories and souls. It was intended, alongside the [[Ouroboros Stone]]s, to act as a weapon against [[Consul]]s and [[Z]]. The blade's properties allow it to cut through almost anything without issue, and can destroy the very fabric of [[Z]]'s reality.   

Melia entrusted the sword to [[Riku]], who told him to pass it on to someone worthy. Riku later passed the blade down to Noah, who stores it in his primary Blade Veiled Sword/Truthsinger and only unleashes its power when absolutely necessary. When unsheathed, Noah turns his primary Blade into a gauntlet that can be used to deflect enemy attacks. [[Matthew (FR)|Matthew]]'s gauntlets, the Fists of the End, are implied to be a prior form of the gauntlet that was eventually passed down, which when fully activated reveal that it is composed in part from [[Pneuma]]'s [[Core Crystal]]. [[N]] also has his own dark version of the Blade that he utilizes in a similar manner to Noah, with it being implied to be partially composed of [[Logos]]'s Core Crystal.  

When wielded by an [[Ouroboros]] it takes the form of The Blade of Origin, a weapon that is said to be able to cut through reality itself due to the connection between Aionios's existence and Origin's use of souls.  

== Story ==
One day after training, Noah, [[Eunie]], [[Lanz]], and [[Joran]] went to see Riku after seeing that Noah appeared to have difficulties with his Blade, when in reality Noah was just hesitant to summon it. Riku offered him the Lucky Seven, a legendary sword crafted by seven Nopon. Noah was initially hesitant to accept it, but Riku convinced him to take it and use it whenever he truly needs it.

During the party's fight against Consul [[K]], K continuously heals his damage using [[Colony 4]]'s Flame Clock. In order to prevent this, Noah and [[Mio]] [[Interlink]] and jump toward the [[Ferronis]]'s Flame Clock. As they get close to the Flame Clock, Noah releases the Interlink and proceeds to unleash Lucky Seven and use it to slice the Flame Clock in half, liberating Colony 4 from the war between [[Keves]] and [[Agnus]]. As the party travels more across Aionios, Noah uses Lucky Seven to cut the other [[Colony|colonies]]' Flame Clocks to liberate them from the war.

After vowing not to take the same path as N and discovering that [[M]] sacrificed herself to save Mio, Noah is able to use Ouroboros to turn the Lucky Seven into The Blade of Origin. 

Just before Origin is restarted, Noah decides to throw the Lucky Seven and his Veiled Sword into the sea, beginning the reconstruction of the worlds.

== Gameplay ==
After Noah cuts Colony 4's Flame Clock, he unlocks the [[Infinity Blade (XC3)|Infinity Blade]] [[Battle Arts (XC3)|Talent Art]], which can be used only by Noah regardless of his current [[Class (XC3)|class]]. This art involves Noah using Lucky Seven to perform a powerful slash on enemies in front of him.

During the fight against the [[Queen of Agnus (boss)|Queen of Agnus]], Noah unlocks the Talent Art [[Unlimited Sword]], which can be used by Noah regardless of class. Upon using Unlimited Sword, Noah unsheathes Lucky Seven, giving him access to a special set of arts for 90 seconds. His Talent Art becomes [[Final Lucky Seven]], a powerful AOE art that performs an entire [[Smash (XC3)|Smash]] [[Combo]] on enemies. Initially, Noah has access to five unique arts with Lucky Seven; after defeating N in the [[Eternal Prison]] in the [[Origin Interior]], a sixth art, [[Harmonic Wave]], is unlocked. Depending on the [[Role]] of Noah's current class, all of his regular Lucky Seven arts (except [[Gravity Blow]] and [[Dimension Ripper]]) will have different effects. While Unlimited Sword is active, if Noah's [[Role]] is set to [[Attacker]], all attacks - both auto-attacks and Arts - have a chance of inflicting [[Doom (XC3)|Doom]] on any enemy except Unique monsters and bosses. 

Additionally, when Noah is under the effects of Unlimited Sword, controlling his Ouroboros will grant access to the unique Talent art, [[Origin Blade]], a powerful AOE multi-hit attack that lowers all enemies' stats upon the final hit. It can also be used without having to use Unlimited Sword during a level 3 Interlink - the Talent Art changes from [[Mega Spinning Edge]] to Origin Blade in the very last gauge bar of the Interlink before it overheats.

If the [[Archsage's Gauntlet]] is tackled with the difficulty set to Hard, Noah will be unable to use Lucky Seven arts, which includes Infinity Blade and Unlimited Sword, unless the [[Lucky Seven License]] is obtained.

=== Class Stats ===
When under Unlimited Sword, Noah will assume one of three special classes, depending on the role he has when starting the stance. The class he enters matches his initial role, so for example he will assume the Defender special class if he used the Art as a Defender.

Each of these special classes has its own set of multipliers, which multiply Noah's base stats and set his Physical and Ether Defense. Internally, each class is programmed with 20 Ranks just as with other classes, however, there are no stat differences between Ranks, and Noah cannot advance beyond Rank 1 in any of these classes (any CP gains are awarded to his original class).

=== Weapon Stats ===
Noah's Attack stat after being modified by the above class stats is further modified by adding the class's weapon stat, which depends on his [[Level (XC3)|Level]], to obtain the final base Attack stat. These weapon stats also determine his Critical Rate and Block Rate while using Lucky Seven.

The weapon stats are the same irrespective of the role Noah is employing.&lt;!-- In the exercise of saving space, only every tenth level is displayed --&gt;

=== Skills ===
Internally, Noah is considered to be in a separate class during the time Unlimited Sword is active. This class and its associated skills depend on the role Noah originally has, and do not scale with Noah's level or rank within his original class.&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jk31xdLvfPrOjoQtGr-6PRH_4Cd2B_k_dFGSS6vSJ1g Postgame Combat document containing mechanics on Lucky Seven&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- I did not find an internal name for these skills, and some effects do not have internal descriptions; the combat document cited gives skill names that may be unofficial, and thus I have omitted these names for now. For their descriptions, I worded them to be as similar to XC3 menu wording as possible -MagmaHound --&gt;

== Etymology ==
Lucky 7 refers to seven being typically portrayed as a lucky and/or holy number, especially in Christianity and in Japanese culture. It is also closely associated with gambling, as combinations of sevens often yield the highest profit possible from a spin/round.

== Trivia ==
* When fighting against [[Keves]]i or [[Agnus|Agnian]] soldiers, if Noah unsheathes Lucky Seven, he will fight using the blunt side of the sword instead of the blade side. This is due to Noah not wanting to kill anyone else from Keves and Agnus.

{{quote|You embody all our hopes... Our dreams of how this world should be. Even though you and your friends should never have existed, the fact you are here is proof enough.|M}}
'''M''' (Japanese: {{Lang|jp|&#12456;&#12512;}}, ''Emu'') is a character in {{XC3}}.

== Overview ==
M is a previous incarnation of [[Mio]], resurrected as a [[Moebius]] by [[N]] in his attempt to be with her for eternity. Unlike the other Consuls, she is horrified by what she was turned into and is disgusted by her need to drain the life force of other living beings to survive. Similarly to N, she became a manifestation of her regrets in her mortal life while her hopes and ideals reincarnated as Mio. Her Moebius ability is Eclipse Soul, allowing her to temporarily override or swap souls with other people.

== Personality ==
While she still loves the man that N used to be, M cannot forgive him for what he did to her and hates what he has become; despite this, N assumes that she is happy with her current existence in spite of all the evidence to the contrary. She wishes to die, partly to escape from N's control and partly because she believes that her death would be the only way to force N to confront how his wish to stay with her forever had only made her miserable and return to being the kind man that he used to be. 

== Appearance ==
Like Mio, M has gold eyes and long white hair as well as the [[Gormotti]]'s trademark feline ears. She wears a black and gray variation of the standard Consul armor with red lines across the armor, and a [[Flesh Eater]] [[Core Crystal]] in her chest. Her mask, similar to N's, covers her eyes, as opposed to being a full helmet like the other Consuls. The weapon M uses seems to be a purple and darker version of [[Mio]]'s [[Blade (XC3)|Dual Moonblades]].

== Story ==
[[File:Miobaby.PNG|thumb|210px|left|Mio with her baby]]
M started off as one of countless incarnations of Mio, and was a [[Lost Numbers]] soldier alongside [[Noah]]. At some point, she gave birth to their son, [[Ghondor (FR)|Ghondor]]. She is later seen on her deathbed, where Noah and their son comfort her as she passes. Later, Noah himself passes away too, afterwards meeting with [[Z]] in the [[Amphitheater]], who gives Noah the option to become a Moebius alongside Mio, in exchange for working for him. Noah takes the deal, becoming N, and Mio is resurrected as M, at the cost of the life force from all the people of the old [[City]] (and her son's death due to [[Alpha]]'s machinations). As she returns to life, she is horrified by the measures he has taken to stay with her and realizes that he is no longer the Noah she once loved.   

Some point after being reborn as a Moebius, M was overlooking a cliff when [[Nia]] appears and tells her that even throwing herself off a cliff would not be enough to kill her new Moebius form. Nia then gives her the key to the [[Cloudkeep]], the location of where she will be in stasis, and tells her that she should give it to those who will need at some point in the future. At some point in time, she gave the key to [[Ghondor]] in the [[Eagus Wilderness]], believing her to come in contact with the [[Ouroboros]] at some point in the future.

M is first seen alongside N, after [[D]]'s first encounter with the party. She's later mentioned in the story by [[X]], who says that she is the only person who can understand what is going on in N's head, but that she has been absent to meetings as of late. She next appears in the [[Throne Room (XC3)|Throne Room]], where N was frustrated that he was unable to control fate during his encounter with the party, but hopes to regain control of it again. M enters the room, asking what he would do if he did, to which N replies that he would give himself and M "equilibrium", an eternity together with M.

[[File:M's Eclipse soul.gif|thumb|210px|M using Eclipse Soul]]
She appears alongside N in [[Agnus Castle Barbican]] to fight the party. When she stared at Mio, it gave the latter something akin to a headache. She unmasks herself, revealing herself to have a face identical to Mio, causing the party to be horrified. After the party beats the [[Levnis]]es, N and M approach the party, about to fight. But before N can attack, M declares that she wishes to handle the battle on her own, to which the surprised N obliges. M developed the ability to control and possess the bodies of others, which she uses to swap bodies with Mio. During this moment, M told Mio her plan via telepathy to stop N to which Mio agreed to help with. Noah asked M who she and N were, unaware that Mio was possessing her body. M replied that if they can beat them in combat, she will tell them why they are on the side of Moebius. The party obliges to engage her in combat. 

After beating her first phase, the Mio in M's body uses her Moebius ability to force Noah to attack [[Taion]], shortly afterwards using Mio's body to attack Noah. This forces the party to be wary of themselves, but quickly deduce that M cannot move while using her ability. Despite this, the party can't reach her, and continue to fight amongst themselves as a result of her ability. Since they don't have a reliable method of detecting who is being controlled, Taion comes up with the idea to use his Mondo to act as a sensor for who was being controlled. It detects that it was Noah, and it hit him, and Taion noticed that M's body is also damaged if one of her host bodies is as well. With this newfound knowledge, the party engages her for a second time. After she is beaten, N engages the party in her stead. Mio watches from the M's body as N beats the party, while M engages in combat with N from Mio's body. Before N cut the party down, he came up with the idea of forcing the party to watch [[Mio]] go through her [[Homecoming Ceremony]], and promptly locks the party up in the [[Agnus Castle]] [[Ivory Gaol|jail]].

[[File:M in cell in mio inception.PNG|thumb|210px|left|M in her cell]]
As Noah attempted to force the iron bars of his cell open, M calls out to Noah from her cell, wishing for him to stop, claiming she is content that she will live on in others. However, seeing the party try so hard to escape and save Mio, M slowly regained the will to live, and wished to spend time with "her Noah". Meanwhile in the City, Mio meets with Ghondor and [[Monica Vandham|Monica]] to warn them about the Castle's [[Annihilator]] and the betrayal of [[Shania]].

[[File:M death.PNG|thumb|210px|M dying in Mio's body]]
When the day of the Homecoming Ceremony arrived, Mio can be seen next to N on the podium. M is brought to the podium in chains as the party screams out for her. However, they can do nothing as Mio's body deteriorates into nothing. As N tries to execute Noah, Mio takes control from his body, which would kill herself if Noah was killed, forcing N to stop. Mio then reveals that she was in M's body since the battle outside of Agnus Castle, that M was the one to die in her own body, causing N to completely lose his sanity. Thanks to Mio, the City was moved to avoid the Annihilator after X fired it after the [[Queen of Agnus]] was destroyed. Mio later revealed that M's soul merged with her, granting her access to M's knowledge, emotions, and memories, including the location of the true Queen of Agnus and the key needed to access it.

M reappears alongside N in spirit form at the conclusion of the final battle with [[Z&#8734;]], sacrificing herself with N to destroy Z for good and entrusting Noah and his allies with the future they could not protect.

Moebius M is fought at level 100 alongside [[N]] during the [[Challenge Battle Mode|Challenge Battle]] ''[[N and M]]''.
{{clr}}

== Trivia == 
* M is the only playable Moebius in {{XC3|-}} as she, in Mio's body, can be controlled during both of the boss fights with M. Moreover, due to being confined in [[Li Garte Prison Camp]] during the final part of ''[[Chapter 5 (XC3)|Chapter 5]]'', M cannot be controlled anywhere except Li Garte Prison Camp and the "Moebius M" boss. As such, she cannot partake in any side quests in place of Mio.
