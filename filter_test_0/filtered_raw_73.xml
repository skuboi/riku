'''Unique Monsters''' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|&#12518;&#12491;&#12540;&#12463;&#12514;&#12531;&#12473;&#12479;&#12540;}}, ''Yun&#299;ku monsut&#257;'') are [[Enemy (XC3)|enemies]] in {{XC3}} and {{XC3FR|sublink}}.

== Overview ==
Like in previous games, Unique Monsters have higher stats and potentially unique skills and arts. The [[Soulhacker]] class is able to learn these should anyone with the Soul Hack skill equipped be in the party when a Unique Monster with the corresponding skill or art is defeated. Unique Monsters have unique names and there is only one of each of these monsters in the world. They can be identified by a red icon on the sides of its nameplate.

Similar to [[Unique Monster (XC2)|Unique Monsters]] in {{XC2}}, a timer will appear during a battle against a Unique Monster that records the party's fastest time and highest difficulty level when defeating it. Additionally, once defeated, a [[Named Grave]] will be erected where the Unique Monster was previously located. If the player interacts with the Named Grave, they will be given the option to resurrect and rebattle the Unique Monster if they so choose. The player can also [[Skip Travel]] to any Named Grave. Some Unique Monsters are fought as groups of up to four and will share a Named Grave when defeated.
The [[Superboss]]es are special Unique Monsters that have special Named Graves marked by red auras that allow their levels to be raised upon rematches, up to a maximum level that varies for each Superboss. There are five Superbosses that can be found across [[Aionios]].

The [[Xenoblade 3 Original Soundtrack|track]] [[:File:You Will Know Our Names &#8211; Finale &#8211; Xenoblade Chronicles 3|"You Will Know Our Names &#8211; Finale"]] (Japanese: {{lang|ja|&#21517;&#12434;&#20896;&#12377;&#12427;&#32773;&#12383;&#12385;&#65374;Finale}}, ''Na o kansuru mono-tachi ~ fin&#257;re'') is played when fighting Unique Monsters.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/XenobladeJP/status/1544218638055800832&lt;/ref&gt; The exceptions to this are [[Seraphic Ceratinia]], which has its own track "Ultimate Enemy" as well as an introductory cutscene, and [[Fogdweller Abaasy]], which uses "New Battle!" when fought. Additionally, if [[Melia]], [[Nia]], [[Shulk]] or [[Rex]] is in the party and the "Special Hero BGM" option is turned on in the Options menu, then "Brilliant Wings", "[[Drifting Soul|Kaleidoscopic Core]]", "[[Time to Fight!]]" or "[[Battle!!]]" will play instead, like with all other battles in the game, with Seraphic Ceratinia once again being the only exception.

'''Urchons''' are a family of enemies in the {{XC|serieslink}}, first appearing in {{XC2}}. They look like [[wikipedia:Sea urchin|sea urchins]] and come in red and blue varieties. They are often encountered after [[Salvaging]] or near water. In {{TTGC}}, one of the four [[Unique Monster (XC2)#Golden Monsters|Golden Monsters]] in the [[Kingdom of Torna]] is an Urchon.

Urchons have multiple defining traits. Firstly, they have a relatively high Guard Rate and can block attacks from any side. And secondly, they cannot normally be inflicted with [[Break (XC2)|Break]]. However, during their "Bouncy Hammer" and "Spiky Hammer" arts, a fleshy stem in their middle is revealed, and they are treated as being inflicted with Break for the art's duration. If one uses an Art that inflicts [[Topple (XC2)|Topple]], they can then be Driver-comboed.

'''V''' is a character in {{XC3}}.

== Overview ==
V is a [[Consul]] who commands [[V's Colony]], his own [[colony]] made up entirely of autonomous [[Levnis]]es. He is callous and greedy, and has a vain and pompous personality without the intelligence to back it up, often making poor decisions.

== Story ==
It is possible that he is one of the oldest Consuls, as V is seen in flashbacks from at least 1000 years ago. At that time he often used his Blade to execute soldiers who had reached the ends of their tenth terms. One such victim was [[Ashera]]. Another time, the execution was stopped by [[M]], allowing [[Crys]] to send off the soldier in the very first [[Homecoming Ceremony]].

Shortly after [[Colony Lambda]]'s [[Flame Clock]] is broken, he is seen watching the results of a battle with [[R]], with both of them placing bets on the battle. The battle ends in in his favor and he claims his reward as [[N]] looks on in disgust.

During ''[[Side Story: Taion]]'', he detects a signal from the Flame Clock of the abandoned [[Ferronis]] of the [[Lost Colony]]. He attempts to assault the colony using his own colony of Levnises. However, the [[Ouroboros]], led by [[Taion]], outsmart him by repairing the abandoned Ferronis and using it as a distraction in order to circle around the back and attack him by himself. Too shortsighted to recognize the trap, and too hubristic to attempt to retreat, despite being given the option to flee back to Z by Ouroboros, he fights and is killed by the Ouroboros.

== Trivia ==
* Consul V appears to be a homage to [[wikipedia:Vaudeville|vaudeville]] villain stereotypes from the 19th and early 20th centuries; the tubes on his helmet appear similar to a handlebar mustache, the helmet itself is shaped like a top hat, and in the English dub he speaks with an exaggerated accent exemplified by cartoon characters such as [[wikipedia:Dick Dastardly|Dick Dastardly]] and [[wikipedia:Snidely Whiplash|Snidely Whiplash]].

'''Valdi''' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|&#12523;&#12487;&#12451;}}, ''Rudi'') is a character in {{XC3}}. 

== Overview ==
He is a [[Keves]]i soldier who is recruitable as a [[Hero]]. Valdi is a mechanic and is the commander of [[Colony 30]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/XenobladeJP/status/1534069329415008257&lt;/ref&gt; He excels at developing and repairing weapons. Valdi loves machines more than anyone else, and has given each weapon he has made a name. While eccentric and better able to get along with [[Levnis]]es than with people, he tries to follow what his "masterpon" taught him: "be a friend to all and an enemy of none".

Valdi is recruited by completing the [[Hero Quest]] ''[[The Kind Right Hand]]''. His [[Class Rank (XC3)|Class Rank]] can be increased to 20 by completing the Ascension Quest ''[[I'm a Mechanic]]''.

== Story ==
Valdi initially meets the party in [[Ribbi Flats]] and challenges them to a battle with a pair of his Levnises to see their power for himself. After defeating him, he formally introduces himself as commander of Colony 30 and the party helps him collect parts to rebuild the Levnises. When they return to the wreckage, Valdi admits how he had hoped that building and fixing Levnises would help him protect his friends from harm but now feels personally responsible for the deaths that his creations inflict. [[Lanz]] inspires him to create something he wants to make rather than something he is obliged to make, and builds a small Levnis he names "[[Mechafriend]]" with the directive to take care of him. 

It is at this time that [[Consul]] [[Q]] arrives demanding that Valdi return to building his "ultimate Levnis". He is reluctant at first but acquiesces when the Consul begins to threaten the lives of his friends; however, the party realizes that Valdi plans to destroy the Levnis rather than allow it to be used as a weapon. Mechafriend begins following Valdi back to Colony 30 under its directive to protect him, prompting the party to go with it.

Valdi tells the incomplete Levnis that he will not let it harm anyone and hopes that he can rebuild it into something better, but is attacked by Q before he can destroy it. Q then possesses the Levnis to kill Valdi, but is stopped by Mechafriend generating a shield around him. The party arrives shortly afterwards but are unable to stop Q from destroying Mechafriend. Valdi is angered when Q dismisses it as "trash", saying that Levnises have taught him that even if he is small and pathetic, he is still worth something. 

The incomplete Levnis is disabled and Q is seemingly killed in the subsequent explosion. Valdi promises to rebuild Mechafriend with a tougher body and resolves to find a way to protect his colony in the way that would allow both his Levnises and his people to prosper. He also volunteers to help the party to repay them for their help.

Later on, Valdi finds that his lieutenant [[Yuzet]] has collapsed from overwork. Yuzet insists that he is fine when he wakes up and that he has to keep working to ensure the colony can keep running, but Valdi and the party volunteer to handle one of his jobs so he can recover. 

The job in question is a Levnis delivery to [[Colony Lambda]] for surveying purposes. After delivering them to [[Isurd]], he mentions that a flock of [[Ansel]]s from the [[Uraya]]n Mountains have been draining their water supplies and eating the plants the colony uses to make medicine. Valdi notices that Isurd has also been overworking himself, and the party offers to fight the Ansels off. Upon their success, [[Taion]] notes the presence of flowers that don't normally grow in the region, causing the others to speculate that perhaps the Ansels carried their seeds in their feathers. Valdi is inspired by the flowers' persistence and adaptability, and requests that Isurd keep an eye on their growth when they return to the colony. Isurd admits that he had at first believed Valdi to be a ruthless commander willing to do anything for victory, and Valdi himself acknowledges his regret over having sent so many Levnises to their destruction. However, Isurd and the party remind him that what he did then was just one aspect of his work, one which he no longer has to follow now that Colony 30 is free. 

By the time the party returns to the colony, Yuzet has received a report that the colony's stocks of [[Levnite]] are depleted and that [[Colony 4]] isn't able to resupply them. The party immediately departs for Colony 4; when they arrive, [[Solon]] explains that the soldiers sent to mine the Levnite from the [[Dannagh Desert (XC3)|Dannagh Desert]] had stopped responding to communications and might be in danger. The party discovers that they have been attacked by [[Forin Skeeter|Skeeters]] that had been driven away from their normal habitat in the [[Great Cotte Falls]] by the [[Forin Ansel|Ansels]]. Upon returning, Valdi is pleasantly surprised to learn that Colony 30 has forged alliances with Colony Lambda and Colony 4 thanks to his actions and renews his commitment to "fixing" the world so it can have a better future. Yuzet is irritated by the prospect of Valdi making more work for him, but the party believes that their friction is simply part of how they interact with each other.

Valdi later joins Noah and his allies in their final battle against [[Z&#8734;]], where alongside all of the other [[Hero]]es they encountered on their journey, he can be summoned by [[Melia]] and [[Nia]] to help fight against [[X&#8734;]] or [[Y&#8734;]].
