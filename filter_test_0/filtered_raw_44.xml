{{quote|Finding a path that lets us all live, I will make that my mission.|Mio}}
'''Mio''' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|&#12511;&#12458;}}, ''Mio'') is a playable character and, along with [[Noah]], a protagonist of {{XC3}}.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Xenoblade-Chronicles-3-2168340.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Overview ==
Mio is a soldier of [[Agnus]] and from [[Colony Gamma]] along with [[Sena]] and [[Taion]]. She is an [[off-seer]] who was initially working for Colony Gamma's arms expansion force.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/XenobladeJP/status/1531888805162397696&lt;/ref&gt; Mio is an Agnian human with [[Flesh Eater]] [[Blade (XC2)|Blade]] and [[Gormotti]] traits.

== Personality ==
Mio is serious and gentle, and writes in a diary as a hobby. She is on her tenth [[Term]] and has about three more months left to live by the time she meets Noah; consequently, the question of her legacy weighs deeply on her. Despite seeming calm and unconcerned about her impending death, she is in fact deeply distraught by it and merely hides her anxiety from others. She is further burdened by [[Miyabi]]'s sacrifice to save her life, especially since she was the older of the two. 

== Story ==
=== Previous Lives ===
Prior to the merging of the two worlds and the creation of [[Aionios]], the original Mio lived in [[Alrest]]. As part of the [[Origin]] system, Mio was repeatedly reborn in Aionios as a soldier of Agnus. One incarnation of her would seek to end the cycle of war with her lover Noah, with the two of them having a son named [[Ghondor (FR)|Ghondor]], but ended up passing away. Through some strange accident, her hopes and ideals managed to be reborn once more as "Mio" while her guilt for becoming [[Moebius]] coalesced into the [[Consul]] [[M]].

=== Early Terms ===
An unknown amount of time later, an incarnation of Mio was reborn and assigned to [[Colony Theta]] along with [[Sena]] who she became close friends with. At some point, she was partnered with [[Miyabi]] as an [[Off-seer]] unit, which she initially was not pleased about. However, she eventually grew to embrace her position as off-seer and became close with Miyabi.

Around her fifth term, she, along with Sena, Miyabi, and most of Colony Theta, were transferred to [[Colony Omega]] by Consul [[Y]], where they were subjected to daily examinations to further Y's research. One day, an accident caused toxic gas to be released from the colony's [[Flame Clock]]. Mio and Sena were carried to an escape pod by Miyabi, who gave Mio her off-seer [[Flute]], before an explosion happened.

At some point later, Mio and Sena were transferred to [[Colony Gamma]], where they would be paired up with [[Taion]], [[Hackt]], and [[Manana]], and become good friends with [[Kyrie]].

=== Becoming Ouroboros ===
Mio, Sena, and Taion are given a special mission to intercept a mysterious airship in [[Alfeto Valley]]. Mio and her team arrive at the airship's [[Gura Flava Lowlands|crash site]] at the same time as Noah, [[Lanz]], and [[Eunie]]. As they battle, the airship's sole survivor, [[Guernica Vandham]], intervenes and stops the fighting, claiming he knows their "true enemy". However, he is shot by a [[Moebius D &amp; J|Moebius]], who, after killing both Hackt and [[Mwamba]], attacks Mio and Noah's teams and quickly gains the upper hand until Guernica activates the [[Ouroboros Stone]] he was smuggling, imbuing Mio and Noah's teams with its power and making them [[Ouroboros]]. Mio and Noah then inadvertently [[Interlink]], forcing the Moebius to retreat, and a mortally wounded Guernica instructs the party to head for the [[City]] at [[Swordmarch]] where they can find answers. Mio and her team then attempt to return to Colony Gamma, but are attacked by their former comrades. They decided to return to the crash site, where they decided to work together with Noah and his team. 

== Gameplay ==
In battle, her speed allows her to easily evade attacks while dishing out damage with her [[Blade (XC3)|Dual Moonblades]], which are weapons similar to [[Nia]]'s [[Weapons (XC2)|Twin Rings]] with yellow energy blades along their edges. Her initial [[Class (XC3)|class]] is [[Zephyr]], a [[Defender (XC3)|Defender]] class. In Chapter 6, Mio gains access to a unique [[Battle Arts (XC3)|Talent Art]] known as [[Dominion Flower]].

In a [[Chain Attack (XC3)|Chain Attack]], Mio starts with 25 TP by default. Her Chain Art is [[Lightning Quick]], which reduces Attacker and Healer aggro by 60-100% (depending on her level) upon completing her order.

Mio starts at Rank 8 in her initial Zephyr class, and has a common [[Gear Support]] equipped when in the player's party for the first time.

=== Base Stats ===
These are Mio's raw stats prior to modifications by class. They serve as a baseline for calculating Mio's stats in a class. Intermediate values are linearly interpolated between these base stats.
{| class="xc1 centered" width="80%"
! Level !! HP !! Attack !! Healing Power !! Dexterity !! Agility

| 1 || 338 || 18 || 17 || 31 || 23
|-
| 99 || 6,754 || 361 || 341 || 306 || 234
|}

=== General Stats ===
These stats assume Mio is at level 99, at rank 20 in each of these respective classes, and is not equipping any [[Skill (XC3)|Master Skills]], [[Gem]]s or [[Accessory (XC3)|Accessories]]. Boosts from skills innate to a class are indicated with round brackets, whereas boosts from having an [[Blade Upgrade|upgraded Blade]] are indicated with square brackets.

== Ouroboros ==
[[File:Ouroboros Mio.png|thumb|Mio's Ouroboros]]
After becoming [[Ouroboros]], Mio is able to [[Interlink]] with [[Noah]]. When Mio is in control, she is able to use arts that deal heavy damage and provide increased evasion.

=== Base Stats ===
These are Mio's Ouroboros's raw stats. The experience level of the Ouroboros which determines its stats (contrary to any displayed level in menus) is the average of Noah and Mio's experience levels (fractions are rounded up).

Mio's Ouroboros [[Chain Attack (XC3)|Chain Art]] is [[Death of 1,000 Cuts]], which greatly increases damage ratio and reduces [[Attacker]] and [[Healer]] aggro.

=== Skills ===
* '''Biting Back''', Evading deals 100-200% of Attack damage and boosts damage dealt by 10-20% (up to max. of 300%).
* '''Eyes on the Prize''', 5-10% chance to evade enemy attack.
* '''Subtle Strike''', 30-50% chance on hit to deal 200% of Attack power as defense-bypassing damage.
* '''Clearsight''', Boosts evasion rate by 20-30% when attacked by targeted enemy.

Following [[Pyra]], [[Mythra]], [[KOS-MOS]] and [[Melia]] figures, Good Smile Company has announced two Mio figures during the Smile Fest 2022, a 1/7 scale figure and a figma both based on her Zephyr outfit. The figma is set to be released in February 2024. &lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/GoodSmile_US/status/1555705471297851392&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://gallery.smilefest.com/tokyo2022/en/images/450&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Amiibo]] of Mio was announced on April 18, 2023.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1648500990788915200?s=20]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clr}}

== Trivia ==
* It is implied in [[Nia]]'s [[Hero Quest|Ascension Quest]] that Mio may be related to Nia in some way, probably her daughter, which is reinforced by their similar appearance and the color of their Core Crystals. This is further supported in {{XC3FR|sublink}}, when [[Rex]] explains how Core Crystals are dominant hereditary traits.

'''Miyabi''' is a character in {{XC3}}.

== Overview ==
Miyabi is an [[Agnus|Agnian]] [[Off-seer]] originally from [[Colony Theta]]. Her off-seeing partner was [[Mio]]. She, along with Mio and [[Sena]] were transferred to [[Colony Omega]] five years before the events of the main story. She is an [[Agnus|Agnian]] human with [[Blade Eater]] traits. 

Miyabi is recruited as a [[Hero]] after completing ''[[Side Story: Mio]]'', which is required to progress the main story. Her [[Class Rank (XC3)|Class Rank]] is increased to 20 after completing the Ascension Quest ''[[Happiness]]''.

== Gameplay ==
Miyabi uses the [[Healer]] [[Class (XC3)|class]] [[Troubadour]], a unique class that can speed up allies' [[Battle Arts (XC3)|Art]] recharge speed.

=== Arts ===
*'''[[Glittering Melody]]''', Party Buff / Fully recharges all arts for living party members except self. (Talent Art)
*'''[[Empty Shell]]''', Field / Fast Recharge
*'''[[Snowdrift]]''', [[Burst]]
*'''[[Sweet Breeze]]''', AOE / Regenerate
*'''[[Twin Moons]]''', Remove Buffs
*'''[[Shadow Parade]]''', Fast Recharge &amp; Increased Damage Taken

Miyabi's [[Chain Attack (XC3)|Chain Art]] is [[Elegant Maelstrom]], which reactivates one additional character, with an X% chance to reactivate one more, where X increases with level. Her Heroic Chain bonus will grant Mio Miyabi's TP if Mio is active when Miyabi is selected, up to a maximum of 99TP.

=== Base Stats ===
These are Miyabi's raw stats prior to modifications by class. They serve as a baseline for calculating her stats in the Troubadour class (see its page for the corresponding multipliers which adjust these stats). Intermediate values are linearly interpolated between these base stats.
{| class="xc1 centered" width="80%"
! Level !! HP !! Attack !! Healing Power !! Dexterity !! Agility
|-
| 1 || 314 || 18 || 20 || 31 || 21
|-
| 99 || 6,287 || 361 || 403 || 307 || 213
|}

=== General Stats ===
These stats assume Miyabi is at rank 20 in her class.
{| class="xc1 centered" width="100%"
! Level !! HP !! Attack
! Healing Power !! Dexterity !! Agility !! Critical Rate !! Block Rate !! Physical Defense !! Ether Defense
|-
|1||172||24||23||34||21||8%||4%||10%||30%
|-
|99||3,457||648||463||337||213||16%||8%||10%||30%
|}

Miyabi equips the following gems:
* [[Steady Striker]]
* [[Disperse Bloodlust]], at level 20 onwards
* [[Refined Blessing]], at level 40 onwards

Miyabi equips the following accessories as her default accessories, which can be changed in post-game or [[New Game + (XC3)|New Game+]]. All equipped accessories assume their Common variant.
* [[Bunnit Choker (XC3)|Bunnit Choker]]
* [[Repulsor Cuffs]], at level 30 onwards
* [[Crystal Earrings (XC3)|Crystal Earrings]], at level 50 onwards

{{For|the boss fight against the enemy named "Moebius"|Moebius D &amp; J#Chapter 1 Battles}}
[[File:Moebius Icon.png|thumb|The Moebius Symbol]]
'''Moebius''' (Japanese: {{lang|jp|&#12513;&#12499;&#12454;&#12473;}}, ''Mebiusu'') are forms created by [[Consul]]s in {{XC3}} and {{XC3FR|sublink}}.

== Overview ==
The Consuls can assume a form called Moebius, which is over 5m tall and bears a resemblance to an [[Ouroboros]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nintendo.co.jp/switch/az3ha/story/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike them, they do not need to [[Interlink]] in order to transform, but doing so significantly increases their strength.

== Etymology ==
The name Moebius may refer to the [[wikipedia:M&#246;bius strip|M&#246;bius strip]], a 3-dimensional object that has only one uninterrupted side. This may be a deliberate contrast with the Ouroboros, which is also named after a shape forming an uninterrupted circle.

== Trivia ==
* Moebius I and Moebius P share the same model. Additionally, Moebius G and Moebius O share the same model as well.
* Z&#8734; is referred to by M as "Not Z or Moebius, but a single, intense desire". Despite this, it is considered a Moebius type enemy by the game.

The '''Moebius''' is a [[Boss (XC3)|Boss]] in {{XC3}}. It is fought at level 10 in the [[Gura Flava Lowlands]] in [[Alfeto Valley]] after being fought as [[Mysterious Enemy]]. Both enemies share near-identical data, the only differences being the lower HP of the Moebius fight as well as differences in AI Arts usage. During this battle, [[Noah]] will be able to use his [[Ouroboros]] at [[Interlink]] Level 0 for an unlimited amount of time. It is later fought and revealed as being [[Moebius D &amp; J]].

'''Moebius D &amp; J''' is a recurring [[Boss (XC3)|Boss]] in {{XC3}}. He is the first antagonist and the first [[Moebius]] met by the party as the [[Mysterious Enemy]], and is the [[Interlink]]ed Moebius form of the [[Consul]]s [[D]] and [[Joran|J]].

== Story ==
While the six protagonists are at odds with each other on the battlefield, the Mysterious Enemy suddenly attacks them from afar, piercing [[Guernica Vandham]] through the chest with a projectile. The Mysterious Enemy then reveals himself, with [[Mwamba]] and [[Hackt]] in his hands, taunting the party to keep killing each other for its own benefit, promptly killing his two captives afterwards, enraging the parties of both nations, who now are working together to defeat this new foe. After beating his first phase, Guernica pilots one of the [[City]] machines to attempt to fight the Mysterious Enemy, but the machine is quickly destroyed without ever dealing any damage to the foe. With his life draining out from him, Guernica gambles everything on activating the [[Ouroboros Stone]] in order to turn the protagonists into [[Ouroboros]], which is successful, resulting in [[Noah]] and [[Mio]] Interlinking. The Mysterious Enemy reveals himself to be a [[Moebius]], and fights the party in his second phase. The new Ouroboros form is enough to fend off the Moebius, who then retreats from battle, but not before giving out a signal that declares the party as the "enemy of the world". Guernica then tells Noah and Mio with his dying breaths that this ''"real enemy"'' with overwhelming power does not belong either to [[Keves]] or [[Agnus]]. He thus advises them to reach [[Swordmarch]]. The Moebius can later be seen in the [[Amphitheater]], being chastised by other [[Consuls]] for fleeing from battle.

He is next fought at the [[Annihilator Foundations]] in the [[Keves Castle]], where it is revealed that the Moebius was actually the interlinked form of Consuls [[D]] and [[J]]. Despite his earlier defeat, he handily defeats the party in their interlinked forms, up until a plan hatched by [[Taion]] and [[Eunie]] forces the interlinked Moebius's under the [[Annihilator]], trapping him, which allows Eunie's Ouroboros form to hit him despite D's ability to sense changes in the air. D then has his arms severed off by the interlinked Eunie and Taion, and his interlinked body falls into the exploding Annihilator, but he manages to cancel his interlink with J to survive the battle.

He is last fought in the [[Cloudkeep]], where D shoots a projectile at the newly awakened [[Nia]], who is knocked out as a result. D and J are first fought separately, before D forces J into an interlink to fight the party one last time by himself. While interlinked, Noah, Lanz, and Eunie try to get J to stop fighting them, which is eventually successful, and J jumps off a cliff, sucking up all of the [[Black Fog]] in order to eliminate both himself and D in one final act of repentance.

=== Arts ===
Moebius D &amp; J's Arts set is nearly identical to the set used when he is encountered at Cloudkeep, with two differences:
*Both versions of Dread Edge remove all buffs from targets it hits, in addition to its usual effects.
*The version of Beyond Death used when below 50% HP has a slightly larger AOE radius (5m vs 4m).

== Trivia ==

'''Moebius O &amp; P''' is a [[Boss (XC3)|Boss]] in {{XC3}}. It is the [[Interlink]]ed form of [[Moebius]] [[O]] and [[P]], and is fought at level 36 at [[Engardo Pass]] in the [[High Maktha Wildwood]]. Uniquely among the game's Interlinks, Moebius O &amp; P is a double-headed creature with a unique mechanic where it uses different attacks and Arts depending on whether it's standing up (with P in charge) or on all fours (with O in charge).

'''Moebius Shackles''' is a [[Status Effect]] in {{XC3}}. It works similarly to [[Bind (XC3)|Bind]] in that it prevents the affected character from moving or taking actions, but their animations will be completely frozen.

The debuff is only inflicted by [[Moebius S]], when she uses the Art "''Stasis Command''", and cannot be inflicted by the player's party.
