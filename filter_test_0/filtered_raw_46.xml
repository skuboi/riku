'''Mwamba''' is a character in {{XC3}}.

== Overview ==
Mwamba is a [[Keves]]i soldier from [[Colony 9 (XC3)|Colony 9]], who is on his tenth term. He is a temporary [[Hero]] who is in the party from the tutorial up until the party defeats the [[Drifter Ropl]]. The [[Moebius D &amp; J|Mysterious Giant]] kills him along with [[Hackt]].

Later on, Mwamba is revived in [[Colony Omega]] close to his [[Homecoming Ceremony]] due to its special [[Flame Clock]] as part of [[Y]]'s experiments. He is forced to fight the party alongside Hackt, [[Cammuravi]] and [[Miyabi]]. After being freed from the control of Colony Omega's Flame Clock, he takes up residence in the [[City]] and joins the [[Lost Numbers]] in their missions alongside Hackt, with whom he becomes good friends.

== Gameplay ==
His [[Class (XC3)|class]] is [[Sharpshooter]], an [[Attacker]] class.

The '''Mysterious Enemy''' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|&#35598;&#12398;&#24040;&#20154;}}, ''Nazo no Kyojin'', Mysterious Giant) is an enemy in {{XC3}}. He is the first [[Moebius]] encountered by the party.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nintendo.co.jp/switch/az3ha/ Official Japanese website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Story==
While the six protagonists are at odds with each other on the battlefield, the Mysterious Enemy suddenly attacks them from afar, piercing [[Guernica Vandham]] through the chest with a projectile. The Mysterious Enemy then reveals himself, with [[Mwamba]] and [[Hackt]] in his hands, taunting the party to keep killing each other for its own benefit, promptly killing his two captives afterwards, enraging the parties of both nations, who now are working together to defeat this new foe. After beating his first phase, Guernica pilots one of the [[City]] machines to attempt to fight the Mysterious Enemy, but the machine is quickly destroyed without ever dealing any damage to the foe. With his life draining out from him, Guernica gambles everything on activating the [[Ouroboros Stone]] in order to turn the protagonists into [[Ouroboros]], which is successful, resulting in [[Noah]] and [[Mio]] Interlinking. The Mysterious Enemy reveals himself to be a [[Moebius]], and fights the party in his second phase. The new Ouroboros form is enough to fend off the Moebius, who then retreats from battle, but not before giving out a signal that declares the party as the "enemy of the world". Guernica then tells Noah and Mio with his dying breaths that this ''"real enemy"'' with overwhelming power does not belong either to [[Keves]] or [[Agnus]]. He thus advises them to reach [[Swordmarch]]. The Moebius can later be seen in the [[Amphitheater]], being chastised by other [[Consuls]] for fleeing from battle.

'''N''' (Japanese: {{Lang|jp|&#12456;&#12492;}}, ''Enu'') is a character and an antagonist in {{XC3}} and {{XC3FR|sublink}}.

== Overview ==
N is the "Golden Consul", who oversees the [[Consul]]s of [[Keves]]. Believing there is no way to escape fate, he pursues [[Noah]] and his allies on their mission to break the cycle of violence that binds their homelands.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/NintendoEurope/status/1541333310449795073&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
N has a similar appearance to Noah, with blue eyes and long black hair. He wears gold Consul armor with red lines, and an "X" symbol on his chest. Unlike the other Consuls, his mask is one that covers his eyes, as opposed to being a full helmet.

== Story ==
=== Becoming Moebius ===
N is in fact a previous incarnation of Noah, who once fought against the Consuls himself a long time ago. After repeated failures to strike back against them, he abandoned all hope of ending the war and had a son named [[Ghondor (FR)|Ghondor]] with [[Mio]], who he would outlive. Following his natural death, [[Z]] approached him and showed him that that in each of their previous lives he and Mio would meet, fall in love, join the [[Lost Numbers]], and die; as a result, he saw himself as being trapped in an inescapable cycle and despaired of ever being able to end it. Noah accepted Z's offer to make him and Mio into [[Moebius]] so he could be with her for eternity. Z tasked N with destroying the City to deprive [[Alpha]] of the lives he needed to create a new world, stating that he would resurrect Mio as [[M]], allowing the two to live for eternity as Moebius.

=== Destroying the First City ===
[[File:N Ghondor.jpg|thumb|180px|N and Ghondor]]
N arrives at the City and proceeds to raze the city, and confronts Alpha inhabiting the body of [[Na'el]], N's great-granddaughter, to round up all the Citizens to create his new world. N and Alpha then duel, with Alpha being surprised by N's willpower (stemming from his desire for an eternity with Mio), and N eventually gaining the upper hand. As N is about to land a killing blow on Na'el, Ghondor intervenes and is impaled by N's [[Lucky Seven|Sword of the End]]. Ghondor asks his father why he was doing this and if this is what his mother wanted, to which N quietly claims the burden is solely on his shoulders, showing some regret for his actions. Ghondor claims that this is not the path that Mio would have wanted Noah to take. As [[Matthew (FR)|Matthew]], Ghondor's grandson, arrives on the scene, Ghondor leaves the future in his hands and used the last of his [[Ouroboros]] power to attempt to free Na'el from Alpha's control, which saves the Citizens but leaves the City physically destroyed.

Through N and Ghondor's actions, Alpha's plan to create a new world is temporarily halted. When M later arrives at the ruins of the City, she questions how N could commit such an act. Rather than discussing the details of the encounter, N simply claims he carried out Z's orders since he didn't want to lose her again. N explains they will continue to live together forever now, but M is unhappy with his choice and how he destroyed everything they once loved. 

=== N and Matthew ===
N later appears before them as the party faces Na'el/Alpha at [[Raguel Lake]]. N duels Alpha once again, with Alpha claiming N's emotions to be stronger than their own. Alpha attempts to invoke Na'el's name to dissuade N from fighting, but N reiterates that he has divorced himself from his past as Noah. N is able to damage Alpha's [[Core Crystal]] and proceeds to try to finish them off, only to be stopped by Matthew, who experiences a spike in his Ouroboros power. As Matthew tries to attack N as revenge for destroying the City and killing Ghondor, [[A]] stops him, informing him that Matthew and N are blood-related, prompting N to reveal himself as Ghondor's father and Matthew's great-grandfather. Matthew is able to piece together N's motivation for becoming Moebius, but the confrontation is cut short by the appearance of [[Origin]] above the [[Cent-Omnia Region]], prompting N to leave. Before departing, N claims he will destroy Alpha before Matthew can attempt to save Na'el.

N later confronts the party at the [[Prison Terrace]] on [[Prison Island]], intending to prevent them from reaching Alpha. A fierce battle ensues between the N and the party. As Matthew clashes with N during the fight, a memory from within Origin is shown to the party, allowing the party to witness the true events that led to the City's destruction. Afterward, N claims that through his sacrifice, Ghondor consented to N's actions, while Matthew quickly refutes that his grandfather would never support slaughtering the City. N subconsciously knows this, as he stops arguing with Matthew and does not retaliate when Matthew punches him across the face. N then falls to the ground and admits defeat, and Matthew promises to strike him down again if he attempts to fight. Alpha then appears from above and hits N with a large beam of energy before engaging the party. 

=== Fighting alongside Ouroboros === 
[[File:Matthew N Face Off.jpg|thumb|left|180px|N and Matthew cease hostilities]]
During the fight against Alpha, N reappears and strikes Alpha by surprise, which frees Na'el from Alpha's clutches and helps Matthew avoid being controlled by Alpha. N and Matthew then agree on a temporary truce to take on Alpha's true form. In a final effort to defeat Alpha, he grants Matthew the powers of his [[Lucky Seven|Sword of The End]] and instructs him to combine it with his Ouroboros Knuckles. This grants the party the true power of Ouroboros, which results in Alpha's demise.

City records tell that N was driven off by Founder Vandham. In reality, N and Matthew came to an agreement to briefly suspend hostilities after the battle. N states that he, as a member of Moebius, will continue to uphold the endless now, to which Matthew responds that the City will continue to fight against them. When N questions whether Matthew could actually take down Moebius in his lifetime, Matthew reassures him that their descendants will continue where they left off. Having seen some of N's buried guilt in their battle on Prison Island, Matthew suspects that one day, N himself might even switch sides and abandon Moebius.

=== Return of Ouroboros ===
Through his success in halting Alpha, N is able to rise the ranks of Moebius and becomes Z's right hand man. N becomes the leader of the Kevesi Consuls, while M becomes the leader of the Agnian Consuls. N holds himself above the other Moebius and views the other Moebius who view their soldiers as pawns in a game as primitive and vulgar, though Z claims that N is not so different from the rest. Many years after the battle against Alpha, N is informed by [[Moebius D &amp; J]] of the return of a new group of individuals with Ouroboros powers. N then begins ordering the Consuls to intercept the new Ouroboros. He continues to watch the party from the Amphitheater alongside Z, and they discover that the leaders of the new Ouroboros group are none other than Noah and Mio. N begins observing Noah and Mio on their journey, waiting for Mio's eventual death to break Noah's spirit. 

N then gets directly involved in halting the party. He brings both [[Ethel]] and [[Cammuravi]] to [[Keves Castle]] and blackmails them into fighting against Ouroboros, and he sends [[Moebius O &amp; P]] to overlook the battle and step in if needed. Nevertheless, the party still defeats O and P, and they make their way to Keves Castle to confront the [[Queen of Keves|Queen]], but N arrives on the scene. The Queen is revealed to be a fake, and N prepares to take down Noah and Mio himself, claiming that nobody can escape the flow. However, the [[Lost Numbers]] suddenly attack the Castle, allowing for the Ouroboros to make an escape. M later arrives at Keves Castle, and N claims he will meet the party again and do what is necessary to preserve their eternity together.

=== Defeating Ouroboros ===
The Ouroboros eventually sneak into [[Li Garte Prison Camp]] to rescue [[Ghondor]] and others of the Lost Numbers, but [[Shania]] betrays the Lost Numbers, allowing N, M, and [[X]] to stop their escape. M briefly engages the party and uses her ability to control the bodies of others to moderate success, but she eventually wears herself out. N then steps in and uses his knowledge of the Ouroboros' weaknesses to overwhelm the party. He prepares to kill Noah, but he stops short once he sees Noah rush to Mio's side. [[Lanz]] and [[Sena]] attempt to kill N and sacrifice themselves by exceeding their Ouroboros time limit, thereby causing an annihilation event, but they are stopped short by X. With X sealing their powers away, N instead decides to take the Ouroboros as prisoners and transports them to [[Agnus Castle]]. 

When visiting the group in prison, he explains his plans to have the group wait one month for Mio's Homecoming, forcing them to watch her die. As Noah attempts to fight back in vain, N berates his naive hopes and dreams, insisting the endless now to be the only reality in their world. In doing so, N seeks to force Noah to abandon his ideals and give into despair as he did, vindicating his choice to become Moebius. On the day of Mio's Homecoming, N tortures Noah once again by forcing him to send Mio off, but Noah cannot bring himself to do it as Mio passes on. N then prepares to execute Noah and the rest of the party. 

=== The Truth Revealed ===
In reality, Mio survives being executed by swapping bodies with M back in the initial confrontation outside Li Garte Prison Camp. Mio uses her new powers to show Noah the turn of events that led a past incarnation of himself to join Moebius and become N. She then saves him from being executed, and N realizes that M was the one who died, not Mio. Mio reveals that M couldn't continue living as Moebius, so she merged with Mio. Noah attempts to question how N could become Moebius after having a son of his own. N is crazed with grief and bitterness, lashing out at Noah out of envy over how Noah's version of Mio was able to stay with him when M did not, and he challenges the party once more. 

During their battle, Noah claims he will end the world if it attempts to hold their lives back, but N claims that it is impossible to change this world. Mio states that M felt imprisoned by N, as N's love for M decayed into an insane, toxic possessiveness once they became Moebius. N was simply content to live alongside M forever, but he was unaware that M never wanted to live forever and that becoming a Consul robbed him of the very traits that made her love him in the first place. M knew his reasons for becoming Moebius, but she hoped by swapping bodies with Mio, she would be able to end N's suffering. Ultimately, Noah and Mio are unable to get through to N, and X uses the fake [[Queen of Agnus]] to allow them to escape. 

=== Showdown with Noah ===
Upon Mio's death, a dejected N returns to the Amphitheater. As the party breaches Origin, Z goads N to continue fighting to preserve [[Aionios]], claiming that the endless now is what he always desired. He challenges the party one final time before they can rescue [[Melia]], continuing to reiterate his falsehoods that they cannot change the nature of Aionios as he never could. Noah states that they just want to carry out M's wish and to save N from his misery, though N insists that none of that matters, once again masking his true feelings of regret.

During the battle, Noah once again asks how N could resort to killing the City's people, to which N continues to spout numerous excuses. He claims their lives were meaningless to Moebius, and that as their ancestor, he held the right to do with the City as he pleased. N wonders again why M could've left him, and Noah finally understands that N has become a prisoner to his feelings of regret and guilt. By failing to stop Moebius and by failing to save Mio in multiple lifetimes, N made the drastic choice to become Moebius. In order to cope with his decision to become Moebius, he clings to his past failures as a form of self-punishment. He once again lashes out against the group but is finally defeated. As he kneels in defeat, he wonders what allows for Noah and Mio to be the ones who lived together and not him and M. Noah explains that everyone he has met shaped him into a different person and that he might have made the same choice as N if he were in his shoes. Mio forgives N for his decision, claiming that a desire to protect the "now" is a very human desire. N finally forgives himself and merges with Noah.

N reappears alongside M in spirit form at the conclusion of the final battle with [[Z&#8734;]], explaining that their existence from a desire for eternity together only serves to strengthen Moebius. N and M sacrifice themselves to destroy Z for good, and in doing so, entrust Noah and his allies with the future they couldn't protect.

== Trivia ==
* N's backstory, appearance, and role in the plot are reminiscent of [[Jin]] from {{XC2}}, [[w:c:xenosaga:Kevin Winnicot|Kevin Winnicot]] from ''[[w:c:xenosaga:Xenosaga|Xenosaga]]'', and [[w:c:xenosaga:Grahf|Grahf]] from ''[[w:c:xenosaga:Xenogears|Xenogears]]''.
* It is implied that N's Sword of the End contains [[Logos]]' Core Crystal. As [[Rex]] and [[Shulk]] give their life force to [[Glimmer]] and [[Nikol]] respectively, Rex claims to [[A]] that "they" ([[Pneuma]] and Logos) would not have objected to their actions. During this line, the camera pans to N's Sword first, then Matthew's Ouroboros Knuckes (which contains Pneuma's core).
