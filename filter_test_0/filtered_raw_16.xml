'''Critical Hit Plus''' is a [[Status Effect]] in {{XC3}} and {{XC3FR|sublink}}. It increases the damage dealt by a character whenever they land a critical hit. The effect works additively, so for example the base 50% boost together with the normal critical damage boost of 25% results in critical hits dealing 75% extra damage.

'''Crys''' is a character in {{XC3}}.

== Overview ==
Crys was the personal [[Off-seer]] instructor of [[Noah]], who was in their tenth term who died and was later brought back as a [[Consul]]. 1000 years ago, a previous incarnation of Crys conceived the role of the Off-Seer and the Homecoming Ceremony with the aid of [[M]].

During ''[[Side Story: Noah]]'', Noah senses Crys' presence at [[Keves Castle]] and enters to retrieve the last shard of [[Origin Metal]] necessary to upgrade the [[Bravery]]. The party enters the [[Throne Room (XC3)|Throne Room]], encountering Crys (now Consul C) accompanied by the now known to be false [[Queen of Keves]]. Crys pretends to ally with the fake Queen, only to catch her unawares and destroy her for a final time before confronting the party himself, easily accomplishing a feat that the Ouroboros had previously struggled with. In battle, Crys first fights the party on foot, then hijacks the Queen's own [[Ferronis]] throne and pilots it in an identical manner to her [[Queen of Agnus (boss)|Agnian counterpart]]. After his defeat, Crys shows his respect for Noah and reveals that he had no ill intentions, and Noah successfully retrieves the final piece of Origin metal.

'''D''' (Japanese: {{Lang|jp|&#12487;&#12451;&#12540;}}, ''D&#299;'') is a character in {{XC3}}.

== Overview ==
He is a [[Consul]]. He transforms into the [[Mysterious Enemy]] [[Moebius]] that attacks the party and [[Guernica Vandham]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nintendo.co.jp/switch/az3ha/story/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to becoming a Consul, D was known as '''Blackblaze Dirk''', an insane soldier of [[Agnus]] infamous for keeping the heads of his victims as trophies and killing his own men for sport - a hobby which he is eager to continue as a Consul.
{{clr}}

== Story ==
[[File:Blackblaze Dirk.jpg|thumb|210px|left|Dirk prior to becoming Moebius]]
As an Agnian soldier, Dirk fought with steel claws and took joy in killing not only his [[Keves]]i adversaries but also his own fellow Agnian troops. He kept a collection of the heads of his victims as trophies which earned him the name Blackblaze Dirk and made him an infamous and feared figure among the Agnian [[Colony|Colonies]]. He's even appeared in a textbook, [[Taion]] read it and found out about him. At some point during the war with Keves, Dirk died and chose to become [[Moebius]] in order to continue his sadistic hobby forever, reveling in the "transcendence" that came with being able to remember all of his past kills.

As Consul D he was responsible for destroying [[Colony 18]] after it reached Gold rank, killing a past incarnation of [[Eunie]].

[[File:XC3 Mysterious Giant 4.jpg|thumb|210px|D confronts the party as Moebius D &amp; J]]
At [[Gura Flava Lowlands]] in [[Alfeto Valley]], D, who has [[Interlink]]ed with Consul [[Joran|J]], impales [[Guernica Vandham]] through the chest before revealing himself to [[Noah]], [[Mio]], and their allies. In an attempt to goad the two squads into fighting him for the [[Ouroboros Stone]], he kills both [[Mwamba]] and [[Hackt]] but before he can face them he is attacked by an injured Guernica piloting his [[Levnis]]. D rips Guernica out of his Levnis and is about to kill him when Noah charges at him and releases Vandham from his grip. As Noah and Mio's squads try their best to fight off D, Guernica activates the Ouroboros Stone, causing Noah and Mio to become [[Ouroboros]] and interlink for the first time. In their new Ouroboros form, Noah and Mio gain the upper hand over D who decides to flee the scene, but not before sending a message to his fellow [[Consul]]s alerting them of the reemergence and allowing them to turn the other humans against them.

Upon his return to [[Origin]], D is berated by [[P]] for his failure to defeat Ouroboros but he claims that he did precisely what he was meant to do. After [[K]] is defeated by the party, D criticizes him for putting too much stock in his Irises but is ridiculed by P, [[O]] and [[H]] for retreating during his previous battle. Their argument is interrupted by J who requests to go out alone, to which D agrees.

[[File:D Unmasked.jpg|thumb|210px|left|D reveals himself to the party at Keves Castle]]
Picking up a reading near [[Keves Castle]], D (interlinked with J) intercepts the party at the [[Annihilator Foundations]]. He cancels his interlink from his Moebius form to reveal that Joran is with him and removes his mask to reveal his face to the party. As D and J battle Eunie and Taion in their Ouroboros form, D notices Eunie's fear and recognizes her as the Colony 18 sharpshooter he killed in a previous incarnation by touching her eye with his claw and turning her to stone. Whilst taunting Eunie, D fails to sense Taion's illusion and is pinned to the ground by Eunie as the [[Annihilator]] is destroyed by Taion's Mondo. With the Annihilator about to explode, D manages to crawl away and cancel his interlink with J, allowing them both to teleport to safety.

[[File:D &amp; J Cloudkeep.png|thumb|210px|D and J at the Cloudkeep]]
D and J later follow the party into the [[Cloudkeep]], being able to track Mio's movements due to her being half Moebius as a result of merging with [[M]]. As Queen [[Nia]] awakens from her sleep, D in his Moebius form impales her through the chest, seemingly killing her. As the party battle D and J in their Moebius forms, Noah, [[Lanz]] and Eunie attempt to convince Joran to join them. Before Joran can make his choice however, D takes him over by forcing him into an interlink and makes his true thoughts known, calling him a loser. As one final act of defiance, Joran overpowers D and steps backwards over the edge of the Cloudkeep, killing both himself and D in an [[Annihilation Event]].

==Etymology== 
The name Dirk is of Dutch origin, deriving from Diederik. The name can be read as &#8220;the people&#8217;s ruler&#8221;, or &#8220;gifted ruler&#8221;. Additionally, a dirk is a type of dagger.
== See also ==
* [[Moebius D &amp; J]]

== Trivia ==
* D's appearance is almost identical to [[w:c:xenosaga:Grahf|Grahf]] from ''[[w:c:xenosaga:Xenogears|Xenogears]]''. However, his backstory, weapon of choice while he was human, and his role as an initial antagonist are reminiscent of [[Mumkhar]].
