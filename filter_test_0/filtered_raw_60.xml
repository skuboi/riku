'''Segiri''' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|'&#12394;&#12366;&#12426;}}, ''Nagiri''), also known as '''No. 7''', is a character in {{XC3}}.

== Overview ==
Segiri is the commander of [[Colony 0]], and she can be recruited as a [[Hero]] by completing the [[Hero Quest]] ''[[Inhumanity]]''. She is a [[Keves]]i human with [[Machina]] traits. Her class rank is increased to 20 after completing the Ascension Quest ''[[Invisible Bond]]''.

== Personality ==
Before meeting the [[Ouroboros]] group, she goes by her given name "No. 7", the incumbent commander of Colony 0. Unlike the other characters in [[Aionios]], her personality is very robotic with an example of her saying "Affirmative" instead of saying "Yes". Initially, she is so dependent on following orders that she can only act independently by envisioning herself as two people, one of which gives orders to the other. 

Though projecting herself much like a robot, she is still much human and endearing, especially to her fellow colony members, whom she cares about deeply. She also quickly develops a strong bond with Sena, who helped will her to defy Consul [[F]]'s orders and strike him down.

== Gameplay ==
Segiri's class is an [[Attacker]] [[Class (XC3)|class]] named [[Machine Assassin]], which focuses on maximizing the effect of debuffs and can spread them to multiple enemies at once. 

Segiri's [[Chain Attack (XC3)|Chain Art]] is [[Viscous Venom]], and her Heroic Chain bonus multiplies her TP by 150% when she completes a Chain Order.

=== Base Stats ===
These are Segiri's raw stats prior to modifications by class. They serve as a baseline for calculating her stats in the Machine Assassin class (see its page for the corresponding multipliers which adjust these stats). Intermediate values are linearly interpolated between these base stats.
{| class="xc1 centered" width="80%"
! Level !! HP !! Attack !! Healing Power !! Dexterity !! Agility
|-
| 1 || 433 || 23 || 21 || 31 || 22
|-
| 99 || 7,224 || 383 || 345 || 308 || 219
|}

=== General Stats ===
These stats assume Segiri is at rank 20 in her class.
{| class="xc1 centered" width="100%"
! Level !! HP !! Attack
! Healing Power !! Dexterity !! Agility !! Critical Rate !! Block Rate !! Physical Defense !! Ether Defense
|-
| 1, base||346||48||5||37||16||20%||10%||20%||10%

|-
| 99, with default accessories||5,779||1,335||86||369||164||30%||20%||20%||10%
|}

Segiri equips the following [[gem]]s:
* [[Doublestrike]]
* [[Swelling Scourge]], at level 20 onwards
* [[Refined Incantation]], at level 40 onwards

Segiri equips the following accessories as her default accessories, which can be changed in post-game or [[New Game + (XC3)|New Game+]]. All equipped accessories assume their Common variant.
* [[Steam Belt (XC3)|Steam Belt]]
* [[Tear Amulet]], at level 30 onwards
* [[Bloody Orb (XC3)|Bloody Orb]], at level 50 onwards

'''No. 7 Segiri''' is fought at level 115 during the second wave of the [[Challenge Battle Mode|Challenge Battle]] ''[[Heroes Frontline]]''.
&lt;/tabber&gt;
{{clr}}

== Etymology ==
The name "Segiri" is coined by [[Sena]] after she had brought No. 7 some onigiri as a peace offering, as she did not wish to refer to her as a number.  Segiri is a combination of "Se" from her name, No. 7, and "giri" from the onigiri. 

Similar portmanteaus exist for her names in other languages as well. For example, in Japanese, her name "Nagiri" comes from ''"Nana"'', the word for the number seven, and ''"giri"'' from onigiri. 

== Trivia ==
* Onigiri becomes her favorite food after having it introduced to her.
* She is the youngest Hero in {{XC3|-}}.

{{Quote|Taion, all of you... I won't let this creep lay a finger on anyone!|Sena}}
'''Sena''' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|&#12475;&#12490;}}, ''Sena'') is a playable character in {{XC3}}.

== Overview ==
Sena is a soldier from [[Agnus]] along with [[Mio]] and [[Taion]] and from [[Colony Gamma]]. She is an Agnian human with [[Blade (XC2)|Blade]] traits.

== Personality ==
Sena has worked alongside Mio, whom she loves like an older sister and affectionately calls her Mimi (Japanese: {{Lang|jp|&#12511;&#12458;&#12385;&#12419;&#12435;}}, ''Miochan''), for a while. She enjoys muscle training and has a cheerful and energetic personality, although she's shy and lacks confidence in herself around others.

== Story ==
=== Early Terms ===
At some point, Sena assigned to [[Colony Theta]], where she met [[Mio]], who she became close friends with, and later became friends with [[Miyabi]] when Mio became an [[Off-seer]].

Around her fourth term, Sena, along with Mio, Miyabi, and most of Colony Theta, were transferred to [[Colony Omega]] by [[Consul]] [[Y]], where they were subjected to daily examinations to further Y's research. One day, an accident caused toxic gas to be released from the colony's [[Flame Clock]]. Injured, Sena and Mio were carried to an escape pod by Miyabi and were able to escape before an explosion happened.

At some point later, Sena and Mio were transferred to [[Colony Gamma]], where they would be paired up with [[Taion]], [[Hackt]], and [[Manana]], and become good friends with [[Kyrie]].

=== Becoming Ouroboros ===
Sena, Mio, and Taion are given a special mission to intercept a mysterious airship in [[Alfeto Valley]]. Sena and her team arrive at the airship's [[Gura Flava Lowlands|crash site]] at the same time as [[Noah]], [[Lanz]], and [[Eunie]]. As they battle, the airship's sole survivor, [[Guernica Vandham]], intervenes and stops the fighting, claiming he knows their "true enemy". However, he is shot by a [[Moebius D &amp; J|Moebius]], who, after killing both Hackt and [[Mwamba]], attacks both teams and quickly gains the upper hand until Guernica activates the [[Ouroboros Stone]] he was smuggling, imbuing both teams with its power and making them [[Ouroboros]]. After Moebius retreats, a mortally wounded Guernica instructs the party to head for the [[City]] at [[Swordmarch]] where they can find answers. Sena and her team then attempt to return to Colony Gamma, but are attacked by their former comrades. They decided to return to the crash site, where they decided to work together with Noah and his team. 

== Gameplay ==
Despite her petite figure, she has great strength, which allows her to wield her [[Blade (XC3)|Comet Mallet]] effortlessly. Sena's initial [[Class (XC3)|class]] is [[Ogre]].

In a [[Chain Attack (XC3)|Chain Attack]], Sena starts with 15 TP by default. Her [[Chain Attack (XC3)|Chain Art]] is [[Bombshell Blitz]], which grants a 60-100% chance (depending on her level) for attacks in the Chain Attack to be unblockable.

Sena starts at Rank 8 in her initial Ogre class, and has a common [[White Wraps]] equipped when in the player's party for the first time.

=== Base Stats ===
These are Sena's raw stats prior to modifications by class. They serve as a baseline for calculating Sena's stats in a class. Intermediate values are linearly interpolated between these base stats.
{| class="xc1 centered" width="80%"

|-
| 99 || 7,125 || 398 || 346 || 282 || 216
|}
=== General Stats ===
These stats assume Sena is at level 99, at rank 20 in each of these respective classes, and is not equipping any [[Skill (XC3)|Master Skills]], [[Gem]]s or [[Accessory (XC3)|Accessories]]. Boosts from skills innate to a class are indicated with round brackets, whereas boosts from having an [[Blade Upgrade|upgraded Blade]] are indicated with square brackets.

[[File:XC3 Seraph Weapon Icon.png|thumb|The Seraph class icon]]
'''Seraph''' is an [[Agnus|Agnian]] [[Attacker]] [[Class (XC3)|class]] in {{XC3}}.

== Overview ==
Seraph is the class of [[Cammuravi]]. It employs the use of self-damaging Arts to greatly increase one's damage at lower health values.
It is unlocked after completing the [[Hero Quest]] ''[[A Twist of Fate]]''. The [[Class Rank (XC3)|Class Rank]] maximum is increased to 20 by reaching rank 10 in both Seraph and [[Flash Fencer]] classes, and going to the now-unlocked lab in Colony Omega.

== Class Stats ==
The Seraph class grants the following multipliers to a character's base stats (see their individual pages for their base stats), and sets their Physical and Ether Defense to the following values, depending on their current Rank. Intermediate values are linearly interpolated between the minimum and maximum values, rounding to the nearest percent.
{| class="xc1 centered" width="100%"
! Rank !! HP !! Attack !! Healing Power !! Dexterity !! Agility !! Physical Defense !! Ether Defense
|-
| 1 || 75% || 120% || 10% || 90% || 80% || 15% || 5%
|-
| 10 || 77% || 125% || 12% || 95% || 82% || 17% || 7%
|-
| 20 || 80% || 130% || 15% || 100% || 85% || 20% || 10%
|}
=== Weapon Stats ===
The character's Attack stat after being modified by the above class stats is further modified by adding the class's weapon stat, which depends on the character's [[Level (XC3)|Level]], to obtain the final base Attack stat. These weapon stats also determine the character's Critical Rate and Block Rate.

Characters temporarily assume these weapon stats to calculate relevant statistics when using a Master Art from this Class without it being part of a Fusion Art. If a Master Art is used in a Fusion Art, the weapon stats corresponding to the character's current Class will be used instead for calculations.&lt;!-- In the exercise of saving space, only every tenth level is displayed --&gt;

=== Superboss Challenges ===
After defeating it for the first time, Seraphic Ceratinia can be re-fought at increasing levels by selecting the "Challenge" option on its [[Named Grave]]. After defeating it at a given challenge level, it will appear at the next challenge level the next time it is challenged, until reaching its maximum level. Thus, only the initial Lv 120 version and the final Lv 200 challenge version can be refought.

Seraphic Ceratinia has the following stats changed from its base Lv 120 version in each challenge version. Physical and Ether Defense, Critical Rate, Guard Rates and resistances are unchanged in these challenge versions. SP is not dropped from defeating it in a challenge, since the challenge counts as a refight.

Seraphic Ceratinia is fought at level 200 during the fourth wave of the [[Challenge Battle Mode|Challenge Battle]] ''[[The Four Devas]]''.
{{clr}}

== Trivia == 
* At level 200, Seraphic Ceratinia is tied with [[Strategizer Nitro]] from {{XC2}} as the highest level enemy in the {{XC|serieslink}}.
* While not a member of any family, it draws upon various monsters for moves. For example, Celestial Dash is a reskin of the [[Ropl]] and [[Aligo]] family's Cursed Cuisine art.
* Seraphic Ceratinia is the only Unique Monster in {{XC3}} to not use the battle theme "You Will Know Our Names - Finale", instead using "Ultimate Enemy" as its theme. Additionally, it is the only Unique Monster that gives the player a rematch option upon a party wipe, and the only Unique Monster to have an enclosed arena indicated by blue lines, both of which are usually reserved for [[Boss (XC3)|Story Bosses]].

'''Shania Reid''' (Japanese: &#12471;&#12515;&#12490;&#12452;&#12450;&#12539;&#12522;&#12540;&#12489; ''Shanaia R&#299;do'') is a character in {{XC3}}.

== Overview ==
She served as a soldier for the [[Lost Numbers]] under the command of [[Monica Vandham]]. Tasked by the latter, she followed the party, completely oblivious of her presence, to monitor and report back their actions after the activation of the [[Ouroboros Stone]] by [[Guernica Vandham]] in [[Alfeto Valley]]. She is formally introduced alongside with Monica and the Lost Numbers when the party reaches [[Swordmarch]] and escorts them to the [[City]].

She is descended from [[Panacea]], and very likely [[Sharla]] and possibly [[Reyn]] by extension.

== Appearance ==
[[File:Shania full shot.png|thumb|70px]]
Shania is a young girl who is rather short despite being of adult age. She has fair skin, green eyes and light brown hair, worn in near shoulder-length twintails with her front bangs pinned back and held together with a hair clip. Her clothing consists of a cropped open vest, mini skirt and forearm guards that have a green military camouflage pattern and red strokes. Underneath, Shania has a skintight black, sleeveless, midthigh one-piece suit that also have matching red lines. In addition, she wears black, long sleeve fingerless arm gloves with red accents and dark colored combat boots with a rectangular metal piece on the toe tip.

Shania's [[Blade (XC3)|Blade]] is a revolver-like pistol, a weapon that once belonged to her late sister, Titania.

== Story ==
=== Background ===
{{quote|I'd known Shania since she was little. I always felt bad that she was being compared to her sister, Titania...but I was always told to mind my own business. I could see how tough it was to be a kid from the Six Houses. I should have tried to do more...|[[Playne]]}}
[[File:FaX9LwZUIAAb1Xd.jpg|thumb|210px|Shania reflecting on her encounter with a Moebius]]
Shania was born into one of the six founding houses of The City, House Reid, known for its emphasis on honor and status. Growing up, she was close friends with [[Ghondor]], a member of House Vandham. From a young age, Shania aspired to follow in the footsteps of her father and Ghondor's grandfather, Guernica Vandham, and become a hero who would protect the City and be respected and admired by her peers.

However, her true passion was painting, something that both her father and Ghondor recognized and encouraged her to pursue. With the passing of her sister Titania, who was considered the family's pride, Shania was tasked with fulfilling the family's expectations and&#160;adopted her sister's Blade as her own to carry on the Reid's legacy.

With the loss of her father, Shania lost a crucial source of support that prioritized her happiness over the family's reputation. Left alone with her critical and demanding mother, who never seemed satisfied with her efforts, Shania struggled to live up to her mother's impossibly high expectations and earn her approval. Despite her persistent efforts to impress her mother and make her proud, she was never able to find success and the constant disappointment from her mother took a toll on Shania's self-esteem and left her feeling unsupported and alone.

As the Reid household's sole heir, Shania focused all of her attention on making it as one of the six candidates for the Ouroboros selection test but failed several times. She tried to emulate Ghondor, even copying her weapon and boxing bandages, believing it would help her succeed. This in turn frustrated Ghondor, as she did not like seeing Shania mimicking her and not being true to herself.

Ghondor tried to steer Shania back to her passions and true self, but her advice came across as harsh and unsympathetic. Shania took Ghondor's words as a personal rejection and became fixated on proving her superiority to her friend. As Shania's obsession grew, Ghondor eventually gave up trying to reach her, feeling that her message was falling on deaf ears. The two grew distant and their friendship began to deteriorate.

Despite all her efforts and struggles, she only managed to make it to eighth place out of 100 candidates. Though initially pleased with her accomplishment, her mother's disdain for not being selected as one of the top six shattered her self-esteem, leading her to abandon her love for painting, destroying her artwork and supplies in her bitter frustration.

=== Awakening of the Ouroboros ===
Shania eventually became convinced that the endless war of [[Aionios]] and the promise of being reborn in a clone body after death was preferable to a future in which people like herself supposedly wouldn't be able to live in peace, and was persuaded by [[X]] to submit to her jealousy and despair; she started spying on the Lost Numbers, eventually having a [[Flame Clock]] installed and openly betraying the party and the City to the [[Consul]]s. Following the defeat of [[N]] at [[Agnus Castle]] and the revelation that the City evaded its supposed destruction, she shoots herself.

=== Becoming Moebius ===
[[File:Shania breakdown.jpg|thumb|210px|Shania's breakdown after being cornered.]]
Sometime later, Shania is resurrected and reawakens in a pool of water as the [[Consul]] S. She is greeted by X, who welcomes her into their ranks and shows her an image of Ghondor in the water's reflection, encouraging her to take revenge on the "faker". She attacks the City by freezing it in time so she can arrange its citizens as her "art", drawing the attention of Ghondor and the party at the [[Great Sword's Hilt]]. [[Sena]], Ghondor, and their allies defeat her, and she realizes that her friends and father genuinely appreciated her supposedly useless talent as she dies. Subsequently, while the party mourns her at the [[Remembrance Stones]], her mother arrives and shows no remorse for her passing, condemning her for dying as a mortal enemy of the City; this prompts threats from her rivals Ghondor and Monica, the latter of whom does so nonverbally and physically, upon which she flees.
{{clr}}

== Personality ==
[[File:FaX9LwLVUAAp0ek.jpg|thumb|210px]]
In her first appearance, Shania comes off as aloof and even somewhat impassive yet is helpful in assisting the main characters by guiding them to the City. She starts off as being soft-spoken and expresses very little in emotions in her introduction, with her face either having an indifferent or sullen expression.

Because of the contempt she had for her own life, the concept of being in the endless cycle where one can be reborn after death and have a reset in life should their life end in failure appealed greatly to Shania. Joining in the endless cycle, where one is given another chance at life, enticed Shania to betray the Lost Numbers and join Moebius. Even going so far as betraying the entire City in a [[Annihilator|move]] that almost certainly would have destroyed her homeland and cause genocide to her people.

After revealing her betrayal to the group and thwarting their plan to escape the [[Li Garte Prison Camp]], Shania's personality shows a shift into a more abrasive, callous, wrathful and maniacal one, contrasting starkly from how she previously conducted herself. Her voice becomes more aggressive and dramatic and she laughs maniacally while gloating when she believes she has the upper hand against Ghondor and the heroes.

A deeper look into Shania reveals the root of her struggles are a deep-seated sense of low self-esteem, a feeling of loneliness, and a constant yearning for validation and approval from others, particularly from her mother and Ghondor.

[[File:Shan paint.png|thumb|210px|Shania during her happier days]]
Before her father's death, Shania, while still a timid and fragile person, was happier thanks in part to her father's support and encouragement of her artistic pursuits. However, after her father's passing, Shania was left alone with her mother, who placed a higher value on the reputation of the household name than on her daughter's happiness and well-being. This lack of emotional support and affection from her mother compounded Shania's feelings of misery and worthlessness.

In addition to these personal challenges, Shania was also grappling with the immense pressure of being the sole heir to the Reid household following the death of her sister Titania. She was described as "the pitiable child of a downtrodden house," and her misery was only exacerbated as she failed to live up to her mother's overly high expectations. Despite her own personal achievements, such as placing eighth in the Ouroboros selection test, Shania's mother would destroy her enthusiasm by never being satisfied and only seeing disappointment. Her mother constantly compared her to others who were more successful, particularly Ghondor, further damaging Shania's self-esteem and confidence. This in turn led Shania into giving up her love for painting, likely seeing it as a useless activity that distracted her from becoming an Ouroboros candidate. It would also contribute to the straining of her relationship with former childhood friend and would push Shania to harbor intense jealousy and spite towards Ghondor. This jealously pushed her into an obsession of wanting to prove superiority over Ghondor.
[[File:Ghondor shania painting.jpg|left|thumb|210px|Ghondor impressed with Shania's talent in painting.]]

Shania's struggles are mirrored in Sena, who also struggles with loneliness and a desire for approval from others. Like Shania did with Ghondor, Sena latches onto someone more popular, talented and admired, in her case [[Mio]], in the hopes of receiving approval and succeeding. Both Mio and Ghondor try to encourage Sena and Shania to be themselves rather than imitate others, but their approaches differ significantly. Mio takes a more supportive and compassionate approach, while Ghondor adopts a harsh and brusque "tough love" approach that ultimately pushes Shania into resentment and a self-destructive obsession with surpassing her former friend. Ultimately, Shania's struggles and demise illustrates to Sena what her life could have been like if she had not had the support of a friend like Mio and serves as a poignant reminder to her of the importance of finding one's own identity.

Shania is also paralleled with [[Joran]], as [[Lanz]] points out. Both were artistically talented and not meant for warfare, but were denied the chance to pursue their passion because the world they lived in would not allow such. In addition, both Shania and Joran despaired their respective lives due to the lack of choice they were given, which pushed them into joining Moebius. They were perfect candidates for [[Z]]'s vision of a world for the "meek and frail" who cannot choose, where there would be no losers as they would eventually become a "winner," given enough lifetimes until meeting a desired outcome, unaware that they would be given no such thing so long as Moebius prevented them from choosing.

== Etymology ==
Her name is of Native American origin, believed to be Ojibwa, meaning "I'm on my way." It is also a variant of "Shaina" of Yiddish origin, which means "beautiful."

== Trivia ==
* Shania and [[Z]] are the only Consuls who are never seen wearing a helmet or mask of any kind.
* Shania shares notable similarities to [[w:c:xenosaga:Hammer (Xenogears)|Hammer]] from [[w:c:xenosaga:Xenogears|''Xenogears'']], a character who starts off as an ally assisting the main characters but betrays them during their attempts to make an escape (in ''Xenogears'', the party wants to escape from [[w:c:xenosaga:Solaris|Solaris]], a draconian society, while in {{XC3|-}}, the party wants escape from a prison camp). Both characters suffer from jealousy and a feeling of inadequacy and both characters die regretting their choices.
* Since she wears her eyepatch on her right-eye, this implies that Shania is of [[Keves]]i origin, but it is revealed in {{XC3FR|sub}} that her house's founder was from the world of the [[Bionis]].
* The soundtrack, "A Life Woven Together," plays during both of Shania's deaths.
* In {{XC3|-}}, the number seven is thematic and is frequently referenced, both in obvious and subtle form. Meanwhile, the number eight resembles the Moebius Strip, or the infinite loop symbol. Shania making eighth place in the Ouroboros selection test is likely a reference to this as she eventually joins Moebius after being revived.
* After completing  ''Side Story: Sena'', if the player has Monica in their party and visit the Remembrance Stone, she will have a unique dialogue about Shania's death, saying: "Shania&#8230; We can't leave your name here, but&#8230; Your desires, your hopes&#8230; We'll shoulder them for you." Additionally, when playing as Sena when facing off against X in the [[Origin Interior]], if ''Side Story: Sena'' has been completed, X will taunt Sena in a cheeky manner by inquiring about Shania's wellbeing. Sena retorts by refusing to disclose any information about Shania.
* In the {{XC3|-}} artbook, Shania's page is located in the middle of the section dedicated to the [[Hero]] characters. It could be implied that she was originally planned to be a Hero (possibly temporary before her betrayal) but the idea was scrapped.

'''Sharpshooter''' is a [[Keves]]i [[Attacker (XC3)|Attacker]] [[class (XC3)|class]] in {{XC3}}.

== Overview ==
Sharpshooter is a simple attacking class that provides the party with additional damage and buffs.

It is only used by [[Mwamba]], and cannot be inherited by [[Ouroboros]] members. It is one of three classes (and the only class apart from DLC) with this distinction.
== Class Stats ==
The Sharpshooter class grants the following multipliers to Mwamba's base stats, and sets his Physical and Ether Defense to the following values.

In practice, these multipliers are always in effect, since Mwamba cannot change classes. Intermediate values are linearly interpolated between the minimum and maximum values, rounding to the nearest percent. Although class multipliers are programmed for every Rank, only the Rank 10 values end up being used.
{| class="xc1 centered" width="100%"
! Rank !! HP !! Attack !! Healing Power !! Dexterity !! Agility !! Physical Defense !! Ether Defense
|-
| 1 || 80% || 95% || 50% || 110% || 90% || 10% || 10%
|-
| 10 || 82% || 97% || 55% || 115% || 92% || 12% || 12%
|-
| 20 || 85% || 100% || 60% || 120% || 95% || 15% || 15%
|}
=== Weapon Stats ===
Mwamba's Attack stat after being modified by the above class stats is further modified by adding the class's weapon stat, which depends on his [[Level (XC3)|Level]], to obtain the final base Attack stat. These weapon stats also determine Mwamba's Critical Rate and Block Rate.&lt;!-- In the exercise of saving space, only every tenth level is displayed --&gt;

*'''[[Aero Burst]]''', Damage to [[Agnus]]&#8593;
*'''[[Rising Blast]]''', Side Attack&#8593;
*'''[[Hair Trigger (XC3)|Hair Trigger]]''', Crit. Rate Up
*'''[[Driving Bullet]]''', AOE/Accuracy Up
*'''[[Tri-Shot]]''', Damage to Machines&#8593;

*'''Clinical Mentality''': Reduces aggro generated when using Arts by 40-65%.
*'''I'll Survive''': Boosts Evasion by 20-30% when HP is at 30% or lower.
*'''Power Bullet''': Boosts damage dealt by 10-30% when HP is at 90% or higher.

=== Stat Increases ===
Only the Rank 10 value is used.
