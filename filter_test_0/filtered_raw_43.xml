'''Melia Antiqua '''(Japanese: {{lang|ja|&#12513;&#12522;&#12450;&#12539;&#12456;&#12531;&#12471;&#12455;&#12531;&#12488;}}, ''Meria Enshento'', '''Melia Ancient'''; [[English dub pronunciations|English dub]]: in ''XC'': {{IPA|/&#712;m&#603;li&#601; &#712;&#230;nt&#618;kw&#601;/}}, in ''XC3'': {{IPA|/&#712;m&#603;li&#601; &#230;n&#712;ti&#720;kw&#601;/}}) is one of the main playable characters in {{XC}} and is part of the [[High Entia]] race.

== Overview ==
Melia is a powerful mage-like character who lives in the Imperial Capitol of [[Alcamoth]] prior to the game's events. Her true age is not stated in the original game version, although her half-brother [[Kallian]] is 151 years old. However the art book "[[Xenoblade: The Secret File]]" reveals her age to be 88. In {{XCDE}} her age is also listed in her [[Affinity Chart (XC1)|Affinity Chart]] information after her identity as a High Entia is revealed. [[Riki]], [[Riku]], and [[Manana]] call her "Melly", while the [[Nopon]] of [[Frontier Village]] refer to her as "Bird Lady". Melia becomes playable during [[Xenoblade Chronicles (plot)|Chapter 7]].

Melia is the daughter of the High Entia Emperor [[Sorean|Sorean Antiqua]] and his second consort. Imperial tradition states that the emperor take two consorts; one a High Entia, and the other a [[Homs]]. Melia, daughter of the Homs second consort, is of mixed High Entia and Homs heritage. Melia's mother is never seen and is only alluded to in dialogue as, due to the difference in the rate of ageing between Homs and High Entia, she died of old age before the events of the game. An NPC in the imperial palace states that Melia has grown up to resemble the second consort.

== Personality ==
Despite her status as the princess of the most advanced race on [[Bionis]], Melia is a very humble, modest and kind person, never looking down on Homs as inferior (which pure-blooded High Entia often seem to), though this may be because she is half-Homs herself. When the party first meet her, Melia slaps [[Shulk]] for touching her, suggesting that she was brought up with traditional values. She instantly apologises and offers to help the Homs in exchange for saving her life. She eventually develops romantic feelings for Shulk, although she keeps them to herself. She is implied to be jealous of [[Fiora]], but does not let these feelings impede their friendship. Eventually, Melia accepts that Shulk will never reciprocate her feelings and is content to remain friends.

Melia has a strong sense of duty and, due to her status, believes that she should be capable of doing tasks bequeathed to her alone. Initially, Melia is reluctant to accept the Homs' help to take down the [[Telethia (XC1)|Telethia]] she has been assigned to destroy in [[Makna Forest]], insisting she can do it herself without assistance. However, she accepts their help after [[Chief Dunga]] provides the group with [[Riki]], realising her limits. She is initially skeptical about the [[Monado]], disbelieving Shulk's ability to see the future despite knowing a Seer, [[Alvis]], in the employment of her father. Only after the party defeats the Telethia does she accept its power.

Being a princess and due to a fairly strict upbringing, Melia is partial to polite and formal behaviour, and is one of the most serious members of the group along with [[Dunban]]. Her lack of familiarity with others is also due to her isolation growing up - she was raised mostly alone in her living quarters until being sent to destroy the Telethia. In spite of this, she retains a sense of humour and does not seem to mind Riki calling her "Melly". However, when she jokes, she normally does so with a completely straight face, so people, particularly [[Reyn]], usually think she is being serious, as shown in a [[Heart-to-Heart (XC1)|Heart-to-Heart]] when she jokingly demands that [[Colony 9 (XC1)|Colony 9]] pay Alcamoth for their use of [[Ether Cylinder (Gem Crafting)|Ether Cylinders]] from the [[Ancient Wreckage]], which Melia deduces to be a crashed High Entia ship.

As the Queen of Keves, Melia acts calmer and is overall more mature. She greatly values the lessons she learned from her former companions, having learned to accept her own weaknesses and being able to open her heart to others. Despite this maturity, she gets embarrassed when it comes to personal things she doesn't want others to know, as shown when she prohibits the party from looking too closely in her [[Queen's Chambers|bedroom]], as well as when her fear of [[Rainbow Bug (XC1)|Rainbow Bugs]] is brought up. She also feels lonely from the absence of all her friends, and expresses the desire to sacrifice herself if it is needed to reclaim the future she and her friends fought for. Additionally, being trapped in [[Origin]] for so long has made Melia impatient to explore the world for herself rather than just hear about it from others. 

Melia is also shown to be close friends with [[Riku]], and has great trust in him, with Riku being the one Melia entrusted with passing along [[Lucky Seven]] to someone who can be trusted with its power. Their friendship is also displayed when Melia and Riku give each other a confident and friendly nod after Melia was rescued.

== Appearance ==
Melia is a 1.56 m (5'1") young lady with fair skin, silver hair braided on the back of her head with two large curls just above her shoulders, teal eyes, and a small pair of High Entia wings on her head. Initially she wears a cap to cover these. Her default outfit consists of a blue sleeveless dress with pastel purple, pink, and white detailing. She has a cape, crown, and large sleeves in the same colours, black and white gloves, black stockings, and white heeled dress shoes. Melia wields a long silver staff.

In {{XCFC|sublink}}, Melia has a new outfit; it is a short white and blue dress with large shoulders and a wide waist, a white collar with a large pink bow, thigh-high black boots, and a blue headband with white flowers. She now wields the [[World Ender]], a new staff that resembles the Monado rather than the more traditional designs in the main game. 

In {{XC3}}, her hair has become much longer. As the Queen of [[Keves]], Melia wears a black and grey dress. The dress has ropes on its skirt along with a feather. It has metallic, black stars embedded across the dress, and she wears long, black gloves. As a [[Hero]], she wears a black and white dress and black leggings, and white shoes as well as gloves. She also has what appears to resemble Telethia wings behind her. Like in {{XCFC|sub}}, she wields her World Ender, now referred to as the Elemental Staff, as her [[Blade (XC3)|Blade]].

== Story ==
=== {{XC|-}} ===
[[file:XC1DE-Melia-2.jpg|thumb|right|Melia in Makna Forest]]
Melia is first seen fighting a large flying creature, later revealed to be the [[Leone Telethia]], accompanied by four guards called [[Aizel (XC1)|Aizel]], [[Hogard]], [[Garan]], and [[Damil]]. The guards are killed and Melia is left unconscious and on the verge of death in Makna Forest. When Shulk and his friends find her, Sharla diagnoses that she is suffering from [[ether]] depletion. In order to save her, they have to gather pure [[Ether Crystal (XC1)|Ether Crystals]]. Shulk heads to the [[Great Makna Falls]] to gather them and is attacked by Telethia spawn.

Upon Shulk's return, Sharla revives Melia by shooting the ether crystals near her body. Melia refuses to explain her reason for being in Makna Forest, but decides to accompany them temporarily and leads them to [[Frontier Village]]. When Shulk mentions his battle with the Telethia, Melia is surprised and refuses to believe in Shulk's visions. Only after defeating the Telethia and avenging her fallen allies does she come to accept his power. After returning to Frontier Village, Melia decides to officially join the group and they continue on to [[Eryth Sea]].

[[file:Tyrea.png|thumb|left|Melia meets the assassin]]
Upon the group's arrival in Alcamoth, it is revealed that Melia is High Entia royalty and the Emperor's chosen successor, with the additional support and blessing of her brother Kallian. However, the decision to declare Melia as Sorean's successor does not sit well with the [[Yumea|first consort]], Kallian's mother, who resents Melia due to her half-Homs heritage as the daughter of the second consort. At the first consort's suggestion, Melia is sent alone to perform a very dangerous ancient trial in the [[High Entia Tomb]] in order to prove herself worthy as the successor. Melia completes the trial and is deemed worthy by the forefathers to become the imperial successor in spite of her half-Homs ancestry. It is at this point that an assassin named [[Tyrea]] and hired by the emperor's first consort attempts to kill Melia with the aid of a Telethia, but is driven off by the arrival of the main party group.

[[file:Switch XBC-DE 11.jpg|thumb|right|Melia cannot prevent her father's death]]
After Melia is declared successor in a public ceremony, [[Mechon]] attack Alcamoth and Sorean travels to [[Prison Island]]. Melia accompanies Shulk's party in giving chase, but they are unable to prevent the Emperor's death. Following the events on Prison Island, Melia is due to officially ascend to the throne, but her coronation is delayed for one year, allowing her time to travel with Shulk's party to seek her own vengeance for the death of her father. In the meantime, her brother Kallian serves as regent while an impersonator of unknown identity is prepared to fill in for Melia's public appearances during her absence.

Following the events at the [[Mechonis Core]], [[Zanza]] sinks Prison Island into Eryth Sea and floods Alcamoth with ether. The action transforms the vast majority of its citizens into Telethia. [[Lorithia]] and [[Dickson]] confront Melia and the rest of Shulk's party as they attempt to escape aboard [[Junks]], but the party is saved when Kallian and High Entia forces fly in to combat the traitors. However, Kallian and his forces are in turn exposed to high concentrations of ether and transformed, but Melia is spared from transforming due to her Homs ancestry.

Later, Melia and the party travel to the [[Bionis' Interior]], where they confront Lorithia, who keeps the now mindless Telethia form of Kallian under her command. After Lorithia is defeated, Kallian is released from his existence as a Telethia and is able to share tender parting words that only Melia and Riki can hear.

==== Special scene ====
[[File:The Reticence Of Melia.gif|thumb|150px|Melia's words to unconscious Shulk]]
A missable special scene can occur just after the events of the Mechonis Core when the party first returns to Colony 6 and Shulk is unconscious in [[Linada]]'s lab aboard the Junks. When Linada is not around (this can only take place at midnight), Melia can repeatedly speak to the unconscious Shulk for some dialogue regarding her feelings towards him, and also receive a big heart's worth of [[Affinity (XC1)|affinity]] (probably 300 affinity points like at the end of the Heart-to-Hearts). It appears that Melia was going to do something to the unconscious Shulk, perhaps a kiss, but she would later be ashamed had she not stopped herself.

=== {{XCFC|sub}} ===
[[file:XC1DE-Melia-5.jpg|thumb|left|Melia in {{XCFC|sub}}]]
One year after Zanza's death and the world's creation, Melia travels with Shulk to the [[Bionis' Shoulder]] in an attempt to reclaim the remains of Alcamoth for the surviving High Entia. She meets two of Riki's children, [[Kino]] and [[Nene]], and finds refugees from Alcamoth living on the Shoulder. Among these are [[Teelan]] - a young High Entia researching whether it may be possible to return Telethia to their High Entia forms - and Tyrea, who is guarding Teelan and trying to find a reason to live having lost her mother and her ideology. Tyrea is not fond of Melia but grows to respect her as she sees the lengths Melia goes to in order to safeguard the High Entia, and the two reconcile as "sisters" as their goals align. Melia, with help from Shulk, Kino, and Nene, manages to reclaim Alcamoth and returns to live there, having finally been crowned Empress of the High Entia.

=== {{XC3|-}} ===
==== Melia and Nia's Plan ====
[[File:Nia&amp;Melia.jpg|thumb|Melia communicates with Nia]]
At some point, Melia became the friend and master of [[Riku]], the son of either Riki or Kino. A few decades after being crowned Empress, the two worlds that [[Klaus]] created by splitting the original apart with the [[Conduit]] began to re-fuse back together, which would effectively destroy both. Making contact with [[Nia]] in [[Alrest]], she helped devise a plan that would allow their worlds to survive. Both nations would construct one half of an ark known as [[Origin]] that contained all of their societies' knowledge and their citizens' literal souls, which would allow them to be reborn once their worlds were split back apart and reconstructed. The [[Core Crystal]] of [[Ontos]], which Shulk had found at one point on the shore of Colony 9, was a critical part of its construction, calling it "a gift from Alvis."

Unfortunately, the Origin system became corrupted by the desires for safety and security held by the souls it contained, creating an entity called [[Z]]. It hijacked the whole separation process, and instead of being split apart both worlds were frozen in time and a [[Aionios|third one]] was created between them for the purposes of creating a world without a "future". At some point, Melia came into possession of Shulk's [[Monado Replica EX+]], which she keeps in her [[Queen's Chambers|bedroom]] as a memento. Melia would end up being captured by Z and put into cryogenic sleep in the [[Eternal Prison]] so Z could use her access to Origin to take full control of its systems; however, before her capture she used her power to create the [[Lucky Seven]], or the Sword of the End, a weapon that could be used to stop Z, and entrusted it to Riku, telling him to pass it along to someone who can be trusted with its power one day. The peoples of both worlds, meanwhile, were recreated in this new world but had been completely taken over by Z and its [[Consul]]s using a [[Queen of Keves|robotic double]] of her as a puppet ruler; Melia herself was able to see through the robot's eyes but had little to no control over its actions. Under Z's rule, [[Keves]] would wage a perpetual war with [[Agnus]], effectively keeping the world in "a state of 'now'".

==== Freed From Her Chains ====
After the party enters the [[Origin Interior]], they come across the imprisoned Melia, guarded by [[N]]. After N is defeated, he finally comes to his senses and merges with Noah like [[M]] did with Mio, and Melia is freed from her imprisonment. She tells the party that Z isn't a real entity before teleporting to [[Keves Castle]], which was formerly [[Alcamoth]], in order to free the Kevesi soldiers from the [[Flame Clock]]'s bondage. As she teleports, she and Riku glance toward each other, and the two friends give each other a friendly nod.

==== From Atop Her Throne ====
During the post-game, which is set before the final battle with Z, Melia requests to join the party in order to see the world of Aionios for herself rather than simply being told about it by her aides. During her [[Hero Quest|Ascension Quest]], ''[[From Atop Her Throne]]'', she volunteers to solve three issues that have arisen in her absence: a squabble between her guards and their Agnian counterparts that ended with the latter rallying into a rebel force, a request from [[Zeon]] for aid following an attack from Origin, and a request from [[Monica Vandham|Monica]] to speak to the people of the [[City]] so their spirits might be rallied. 

Upon arriving at the City, Melia finds herself reminiscing about how similar its technology is to that of her old world and speaks to her followers in the City, eventually meeting an old man known as the "Storyspinner" who like herself is far older than many of the people there and knows much about the world's history (including a fair amount about herself). As [[Eunie]] expresses her wonder at how others can grow old and keep going even after seeing so many of their friends die, Melia reassures her that the memories of those that are lost will always remain and that they can be a source of strength in their own right. 

When the party arrives at [[Colony 9 (XC3)|Colony 9]], Melia aids Zeon in healing the injured. He tells them that the colony has lost contact with a survey team sent to investigate a recent landslide from the Origin attack. He suspects a second landslide might have happened and Melia volunteers to look for them. As they head out, one of the soldiers asks for them to deliver a message to one of the survey team members to "give back what she owes". When questioned about this, the soldier in question reveals that they had shared a unit since their first term and that he was just making an excuse to ask after her safety. Melia expresses that she knows very well how important it is to have someone to lift up one's feelings, and Noah privately wonders if she has [[Shulk|someone]] in mind. After returning to Colony 9, Zeon tells Melia that he wishes to allow the colony to elect a new commander with the intention to step down for whoever is chosen. His men wonder why he would want such a thing, and he explains that he was appointed only because the Consul thought him to be a useful puppet and feels that he lacks the qualities that would be suited in a commander of a colony free from their control. Melia does not object to his request to hold the election, but advises him that innate qualities are not everything and recounts her own experiences with self-doubt to assure him that all will be well so long as he remains true to himself.

Nia explains to Melia and the party that she knew about the incident with the Agnian rebel forces; they were in fact an independent faction of former Agnian soldiers who have since renounced their allegiance and now care only for wanton destruction. Melia suspects that they may be suffering a crisis in their worldviews and might respond to mercy; however, she notes that should they be unwilling to listen to reason then she will not shy away from fighting them. They arrive at the rebels' hideout to find [[Levnis]]es deployed there, and Melia recounts her old experiences in battle, Tyrea's attempted assassination, and the value of everything her old companions taught her about life. She confronts the rebels, and their leader rages how he and his friends had believed that defeating Keves was the reason for their existence; ever since the war was proved to founded upon a lie they now have no reason to go on living and may as well put an end to the world. Melia is unconvinced, but the rebels lash out when she tries to explain that she wants to help them make sense of the world. The rebel leader remains defiant after the party subdues them, accusing Melia and Nia of looking down on them because of their greater lifespans; when they insist that he is mistaken, he demands to know who he can hate in order to go on living. Melia's response is to offer that she might be the target of that hate if that is what he truly needs so long as one day he can live for what is truly valuable.

The party returns to Keves Castle, and after chiding [[Aizel (XC3)|Aizel]] for worrying too much Melia tells the party that they cannot lose the spirit of defiance and submit to injustice as the people of her world did once. She expresses the desire to sacrifice herself if it is needed to reclaim the future she and her friends fought for so long ago, but the party rejects the idea and says that they do not wish to see her suffer alone longer than she must. Their words remind her of her old traveling companions, and she thanks them for their continued support in creating a new future.  

==== Escaping the "Endless Now" ====
During the final battle against [[Z&#8734;]], Melia and Nia get in contact once more, with Melia telling Nia that the royal persona she's forcing doesn't suit her, before they change their castles into Ferronis to combat Origin. They provide support to the party by sending in reinforcements before eventually joining the fight themselves. After Z's defeat, Melia and Nia appear to ask the party if their decision to separate the two worlds is final. As the two Queens make their preparations, Melia expresses her hope for the futures of their respective worlds before glancing at the Monado Replica EX+ hidden behind a painting in her room and thanking everyone.

=== In battle ===
[[File:Elemental Discharge.png|thumb|240px|Melia's Talent Art]]
Melia's abilities are based upon [[Ether (Stat)|Ether]] [[Battle Arts (XC1)|Arts]], being a mage-like character with the lowest [[Hit Points (XC1)|HP]] of all playable characters, and [[Strength|physical strength]], while excelling in ether combat and defense, making her very useful against enemies with high physical defense or that specialize in ether attacks. She has the highest accuracy and ether out of all the party members. Her main arts do not immediately damage opponents: rather, they produce an elemental summon, which float above her head with a specific spherical design, and give off an [[aura (XC1)|aura]] that increases the party's stats while they are in the vicinity of Melia. Up to three of these summons can be in play at the same time, including three of the same summons which will subsequently stack their effects, for example three [[Summon Aqua|Aqua]] summons for high health regeneration. Melia has the highest accuracy and ether out of all the playable characters in the game. 

Her [[Battle Arts (XC1)#Talent Arts|Talent Art]] [[Elemental Discharge (XC1)|Elemental Discharge]] effectively uses the elementals she has summoned to attack. This means that Melia's main form of dealing damage is to summon and then release these elements, while she can also opt to keep the elements passively active to buff her party members. Every released summon that attacks an enemy fills her Talent Gauge, allowing her to enter [[Element Burst]] state when maxed, granting her access to some powerful abilities as well as doubling damage caused. Element Burst may be completely used up upon casting an Art; the higher her [[Tension (XC1)|tension]], the more likely she can stay in Element Burst after casting an Art.

Melia starts off with several Arts, mostly summons that grant increased power for the party: they are [[Summon Bolt|Bolt]], [[Summon Flare|Flare]] and Aqua (which grant the buffs of [[Ether Up (buff)|Ether Up]], [[Strength Up]] and [[Regenerate (XC1)|Regenerate]], respectively). She learns defensive Art summons later on, which include [[Summon Wind|Wind]], [[Summon Earth|Earth]] and [[Summon Ice|Ice]] (which give [[Agility Up (buff)|Agility Up]], [[Physical Defence]] Up and [[Ether Defence]] Up, respectively), along with [[Summon Copy]], an Art that summons the previously summoned element, even if the Art is on [[Cooldown (XC1)|cooldown]].

Similarly, she also has a few spells that cause statuses on enemies. She can inflict [[Sleep (XC1)|Sleep]] using a special [[Hypnotise|hypnosis]] spell, [[Healing Gift|heal]] a party member at the cost of her own health, launch [[Shadow Stitch (XC1)|Shadow Stitch]] to [[Bind (debuff)|bind]] the foes' movement, and even [[Topple (XC1)|Topple]] a single target by herself at close range with a sequence of [[Spear Break]] and [[Starlight Kick (XC1)|Starlight Kick]]. Once she reaches Element Burst state, she can gain two single-use abilities, either [[Burst End]] art to decrease both [[Physical Defence Down|Physical]] and [[Ether Defence Down (XC1)|Ether defences]], or [[Mind Blast]] to [[Arts Seal|seal]] enemy arts for a period of time, a status ailments that other party members are unable to cause themselves.

== In {{XC3|-}} ==
In {{XC3}}, Melia can be recruited as a [[Hero]] by traveling to the [[Main Castle Gate]] of [[Keves Castle]] after having completed the game, or in [[New Game + (XC3)|New Game +]]. In battle, she uses the [[Royal Summoner]] [[Class (XC3)|class]], and wields her [[World Ender]], referred to as the Elemental Staff, as her [[Blade (XC3)|Blade]]. By completing her [[Hero Quest|Ascension Quest]] ''[[From Atop Her Throne]]'', Melia's [[Class Rank (XC3)|rank]] as a Royal Summoner will increase from 10 to 20. Her unique theme, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwIMS20A0jM Brilliant Wings], which is a remixed version of the standard battle theme from {{XCFC|sub}}, plays when she is used in battle if the "Special BGM" setting is enabled.

=== Arts ===
* '''[[Element Genesis]]''' ([[Battle Arts (XC3)|Talent Art]]), AOE/Elemental Discharge dmg+
* [[Summon Element]], AOE/Summon Elementals
* [[Elemental Discharge (XC3)|Elemental Discharge]], Release Elementals
* [[Shadow Stitch (XC3)|Shadow Stitch]], Back Bind
* [[Starlight Kick (XC1)|Starlight Kick]], [[Topple (XC3)|Topple]]
* [[Power Effect (XC3)|Power Effect]], Atk up / Def. down

Melia's Chain Art is [[Ether Absolute]], which reduces enemy ether defense by 45 percentage points during a [[Chain Attack (XC3)|Chain Attack]], and her Heroic Chain bonus prevents the order from completing if it reaches 100% through Melia's action, allowing for another character to perform an action. If a Healer-role party member attacks while the TP is at least 100% as a result of this, their Point Limit ability will not reduce the TP to 99%, but the TP will not increase either, and the order will be completed.

=== Class Skills ===
* '''Elemental Boost''', Each elemental discharge boosts damage dealt by 25-40% (up to a maximum of 400%).
* '''Essence of Ether''', Boosts allies' damage by 22-30% and reduces enemy Block Rate by 7-15% (does not stack).
* '''Fortified Ether Guard''', Boosts Ether Defense by 12-20%.
* '''Here I Shall Stand''', Boosts elemental damage by 70-100% and elemental buff effects by 35-50%.

=== Base Stats ===
These are Melia's raw stats prior to modifications by class. They serve as a baseline for calculating her stats in the Royal Summoner class (see its page for the corresponding multipliers which adjust these stats). Intermediate values are linearly interpolated between these base stats.
{| class="xc1 centered" width="80%"
! Level !! HP !! Attack !! Healing Power !! Dexterity !! Agility
|-
| 1 || 480 || 28 || 27 || 33 || 22
|-
| 99 || 6,861 || 402 || 384 || 325 || 223
|}

=== General Stats ===
These stats assume Melia is at rank 20 in her class. Stat increases from gems are shown separately from the base stat, and may not fully apply if Melia has not unlocked the corresponding gem slots.
{| class="xc1 centered" width="100%"
! Level !! HP !! Attack
! Healing Power !! Dexterity !! Agility !! Critical Rate !! Block Rate !! Physical Defense !! Ether Defense&#8224;
|-

|-
|99||4,459||1,193 (+70)||230||422||245||30%||10%||15%||15%
|}
&lt;small&gt;&#8224; Does not factor in the boost to Ether Defense given by Fortified Ether Guard.&lt;/small&gt;

Melia equips the following [[Gem]]s:
* [[Disperse Bloodlust]]
* [[Steelcleaver]], at level 20 onwards
* [[Analyze Weakness]], at level 40 onwards

==== Dialogue ====
* G-gotcha...friendo! Leave it to us...m-mate! Is that correct, Sharla?

== Trivia ==
* Melia is also the name of a species family of plants that the Chinaberry Tree belongs to.
* Her last name, Antiqua, means "old/ancient" in Latin. Melia is the only party member in {{XC|-}} with a known surname.
* Melia is the only female party member in {{XC|-}} whose first name is the same both the Japanese and English versions. In the Japanese version, Fiora is called Fiorung, while Sharla is called Carna.
* According to the Heart-to-Heart "[[A Breathtaking Sight]]", Melia explains to Reyn that when she was young, she fell off the Sky Terrace of Alcamoth's Imperial Palace and survived, but has no memory of how. Reyn is left astonished.
[[File:Antique Princess QT.jpg|thumb|90px|Poppi's RAM]]
* In {{XC2}}, [[Poppi QT]] has a DLC [[Poppiswap|Skill RAM]] obtainable in the [[Land of Challenge (XC2)|Land of Challenge]] known as [[Antique Princess QT]], which changes her colour palette to resemble Melia's {{XC|-}} outfit. 
* In the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rt9pfN-2S0k release date trailer] for {{XC3|-}}, Melia's role as the queen of [[Keves]] was accidentally revealed early in the captions, as it presents her name when she speaks. This error was later corrected and Melia's name was replaced with simply "Queen".
* Melia, Nia, [[Riku &amp; Manana]] are the only non-DLC Heroes in {{XC3|-}} that can never be fought by the party.
* Melia's Japanese voice actress, Shiori Katsuta, also provides the "Upper-class" female voice for [[Cross]] in {{XCX}}.
* Melia Antiqua shares multiple design similarities to [https://xenosaga.fandom.com/wiki/Maria_Balthasar Maria Balthasar], a playable character in in 1997 game ''[https://xenosaga.fandom.com/wiki/Xenogears Xenogears]''.  Their given names are similar especially in Japanese ({{lang|ja|&#12510;&#12522;&#12450;}} ''Maria'' vs. {{lang|ja|&#12513;&#12522;&#12450;}} ''Meria''), they're both (relatively speaking) young women with a centuries-old still-living recent ancestor (Melia's father [[Sorean Antiqua]] vs. Maria's grandfather [https://xenosaga.fandom.com/wiki/Isaac_Balthasar Isaac Balthasar]), come from an ancient civilization based in the sky (the [[High Entia]] vs. [https://xenosaga.fandom.com/wiki/Shevat Shevat]), and are both known for their massive hair curls.  Both characters were designed by Kunihiko Tanaka.
[[File:Eunie Melia Outfit.png|thumb|190px|Eunie's Throwback A Outfit]]
* In {{XC3|-}}'s [[Challenge Battle Mode]], Eunie can obtain two [[Clothing|outfits]] based on Melia's outfit from {{XCFC|sub}}, one of them being a green and black variant of the outfit.
