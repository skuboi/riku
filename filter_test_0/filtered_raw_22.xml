{{quote|Silvercoat Ethel...! She pushed her Colony, all the way to rank Silver, and in her third term at that.|Eunie}}
'''Silvercoat Ethel''' (Japanese: {{Lang|jp|&#30333;&#37504;&#12398;&#12456;&#12475;&#12523;}}, ''Shirogane no Eseru''), is a character in {{XC3}}.

== Overview ==
Ethel is the commander of the [[Colony 4]], a [[Keves]]i [[Colony]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://topics.nintendo.co.jp/article/3ced4c9d-a5e1-43a3-b16e-0005971ed404 Nintendo]&lt;/ref&gt; She wields a pair of slender swords. She is famous for defeating three enemy colonies at once with only 100 soldiers at her command. She is called Silvercoat Ethel by all the forces of Keves. In the past, Ethel saved [[Noah]] and his friends from an [[Agnus|Agnian]] attack.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1522678213654233097&lt;/ref&gt; In battle, she wields [[Blade (XC3)|Dual Rapiers]] and is of the [[Flash Fencer]] [[Class (XC3)|class]].
Ethel is temporarily recruited as a [[Hero]] after completing the [[Hero Quest]] ''[[No Want of Courage]]'', but cannot be used after the party leaves Colony 4.

For Ethel to rejoin the party, a member of the party must reach [[Class Rank (XC3)|rank]] 10 with the Flash Fencer and [[Seraph]] classes. The party then must go inside the lab at [[Colony Omega]] with Cammuravi in the party. By having Ethel undergo the maturation process, she will be able to rejoin the party at rank 20.

== Story ==
Despite her prowess, Colony 4 was reduced to Dirt Rank after her refusal to kill her sworn rival [[Cammuravi]] after she was victorious in a [[Ferronis]] duel against him; his Ferronis' joints had collapsed due to a lapse in maintenance and she did not have an interest in winning what she believed to be a tainted victory. They both looked forward to a future opportunity to duel one another, not out of hatred but simply for their own satisfaction. 

By hijacking her Iris, Ethel is brainwashed by the [[Consul]] [[K]] into seeing Noah and his party as shadowy monsters in order to goad her into killing them. Despite their attempts to flee, she forces them into battle against her. However, K's control over her begins to fail and she stands down before being knocked unconscious by K. Following his death and the destruction of Colony 4's [[Flame Clock]], Ethel learns the truth of the [[Ouroboros]] and pledges her support to them. She is unable to join them for long, however, as she insists on delivering a report of what happened (albeit a false one) to the [[Queen of Keves]] as part of her duties as commander. 

When she arrives at [[Keves Castle]], [[N]] and the Queen reveal that they know she has been collaborating with Ouroboros and threaten to destroy Colony 4 with the [[Annihilator]] if she does not kill them. She is forced to work alongside Cammuravi and pilot a [[Ethel's Ferronis|specially made Ferronis]] in an attempt to kill Noah and his allies, but she and Cammuravi intentionally hold back to give them a fighting chance. Consuls [[O]] and [[P]] attempt to brainwash Cammuravi, but he instead gouges his own eye out to stop them from hijacking his Iris and declares that he will not be the Consuls' slave. The Consuls begin to drain her life force and Cammuravi's as punishment for their defiance, but they ultimately choose to die on their own terms in one last duel. 

Her cradle is later stolen from Keves Castle by the [[Lost Numbers]], who keep it stored within their facility to deny it to the Kevesi forces. However, she is accidentally released by [[Cubibi]] during a game of hide-and-seek and joins the people of the [[City]]. At her insistence and the advice of the similarly revived Cammuravi (who she instinctively recognizes despite having no memory of her previous life), she travels to [[Colony Omega]] and has her growth accelerated to her final term, allowing her to fight with Noah and her allies once again.  

Should the player have Ethel undergo her maturation process, she will later join Noah and his allies in their final battle against [[Z&#8734;]], alongside all of the other Heroes they encountered on their journey. She can be summoned by [[Melia]] and [[Nia]] to help fight against [[X&#8734;]] or [[Y&#8734;]]. Regardless of whether or not Ethel rejoins the party, she appears fully matured during the ending cutscene standing alongside other Kevesi commanders.

== Gameplay ==
Ethel's class is [[Flash Fencer]], a [[Keves]]i [[Attacker]] class. She specialises in felling foes quickly, with increased damage (as well as considerable recharge on her Talent Art) to start a battle.

=== Arts ===
* '''[[Saber Strike]]''' (Talent Art), [[Smash (XC3)|Smash]]
* [[Cross Impact (XC3)|Cross Impact]], [[Power Charge]] on hit
* [[Swallowtail (XC3)|Swallowtail]], Back Attack &#8593;
* [[Silver Cyclone]], Side Crit. Rate+
* [[Acceleration]], Auto-Atk spd. up/dmg up
* [[Million Flash]], [[Bleed (XC3)|Bleed]]

Her [[Battle Arts (XC3)|Chain Art]] is [[Wintry End]], which increases the damage ratio and grants Critical Rate Up to all allies. Her Heroic Chain bonus multiplies her own TP by 150% if she is the first to act in an order.

=== Base Stats ===
These are Ethel's raw stats prior to modifications by class. They serve as a baseline for calculating her stats in the Flash Fencer class (see its page for the corresponding multipliers which adjust these stats). Intermediate values are linearly interpolated between these base stats.

| 99 || 6,638 || 404 || 343 || 311 || 223

=== General Stats ===
These stats assume Ethel is at rank 20 in her class.

== Trivia ==
[[File:XC3 Hero Select Screen.jpg|right|thumb|Hero selection screen during the "Xenoblade Chonicles 3 Direct", with Ethel's profile icon censored]]
* Her fighting style is based off of Niten-Ichi-Ryu. Which is said to be the use of a short sword, and a longer sword.
* Ethel's Japanese voice actress, Atsumi Tanezaki, also voices [[Agate]] in {{XC2}}.
* Ethel is the only Hero that's unable to join the party without completing her ascension condition.
* Possibly to avoid speculation of why she is unselectable, in the "Xenoblade Chronicles 3 Direct" and "Ask the Developer Vol. 6, Xenoblade Chronicles 3&#8211;Part 3" interview article &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-6-xenoblade-chronicles-3-part-3/]&lt;/ref&gt;, Ethel's profile icon is censored when showing the Hero selection menu &lt;ref&gt;[https://assets.nintendo.com/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/dpr_2.0/c_scale,w_800/ncom/en_US/articles/2022/ask-the-developer-vol-6-xenoblade-chronicles-3/pop-up-assets/Switch_XC3_AskTheDev_Popup_09_NOA]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ethel does not have an ascension quest and shares the same ascension condition with Cammuravi. 
* Ethel is the only hero to be shown in cradle and be reborn back to 1st term, she and [[Nimue]] are the only two characters in {{XC3|-}} to make their debut in their late term and then reappear in younger form.

'''Ether Anchor''' is a [[Status Effect]] in {{XC3}} and {{XC3FR|sublink}}. It protects the affected character from being affected by reactions such as [[Knockback (XC3)|Knockback]] or any [[Combo]] while the buff is active. The buff will be removed prematurely if it has nullified enough reactions.

== Notes ==
*Reactions nullified through other means (such as by part of an Art effect) will not consume the buff. When using an [[Accessory (XC3)|accessory]] or [[Skill (XC3)|skill]] that grants reaction resistance at a rate less than 100%, the buff will be prioritized, nullifying the reaction without the accessory/skill. At a rate of 100%, however, the reaction will be nullified by the accessory/skill instead of the buff.
*The [[Crystal Anklets]] and the [[Martial Artist#Class Skills|Feline Righting Reflex]] skill both cancel a [[Blowdown (XC3)|Blowdown]] or [[Launch (XC3)|Launch]] by playing a special recovery animation, without nullifying either reaction. If a character with either the Anklets or the skill equipped has the Ether Anchor buff and is hit by either of these reactions, the buff will be consumed and the character will not be sent flying; Feline Righting Reflex will also not grant [[Attack Up]] as a result.

}}
'''Ether Defense Down''' is a [[Status Effect]] in {{XC3}} and {{XC3FR|sublink}}. It reduces the affected character's ether defense.

==Calculations==
The way that Ether Defense Down interacts with a character's ether defense depends on the sign of the character's Ether Defense:
*If the character's Ether Defense is zero, then Ether Defense Down has no effect on their Ether Defense (though it still counts as a debuff for Arts and skills that rely on debuffs).
*If the character's Ether Defense is positive, then Ether Defense Down reduces the magnitude of positive Ether Defense. For example, a character with 20% Ether Defense will lose 5% with the base debuff, for a final Ether Defense of 15%.
*If the character's Ether Defense is negative, then Ether Defense Down increases the magnitude of negative Ether Defense; for example, a -20% Ether Defense loses 5% for a final value of -25% with the base debuff.

A calculation that combines these three cases can be obtained by taking the magnitude of Ether Defense:

&lt;math&gt;EtherDef = BaseEtherDef - EtherDefDownStrength \times |BaseEtherDef|,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;BaseEtherDef&lt;/math&gt; is the initial Ether Defense and &lt;math&gt;EtherDefDownStrength&lt;/math&gt; is the strength of the debuff.

'''Eunie''' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|&#12518;&#12540;&#12491;}}, ''Y&#363;ni'') is a playable character in {{XC3}}.

== Overview ==
Along with her friends [[Noah]] and [[Lanz]], Eunie is a [[Keves]]i soldier stationed at [[Colony 9 (XC3)|Colony 9]]. She is a Kevesi human with [[High Entia]] traits.

== Personality ==
Eunie is a childhood friend of Noah and Lanz, and seems to excel at healing in battle. She has a sharp tongue, a foul mouth, and is quick to anger, which makes her come off as rude. She respects Noah, and has a close relationship with Lanz, where they can speak freely (although to outsiders it just looks like an exchange of insults); she describes herself as someone who prefers to take things at face value and makes no effort to hide her opinions on others. She has a strong sense of responsibility to her friends above all else.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/XenobladeJP/status/1493844371422199813&lt;/ref&gt; She is easily swayed by her emotions, often causing her to act without thinking. Despite her headstrong and brash attitude, she is rather good at academics.

Eunie is deeply frightened of [[Consul]] [[D]] when he first confronts her party. Though it is initially unknown to her, this is because a past version of her served as a sharpshooter in [[Colony 18]], which was destroyed by D shortly after it reached Gold rank. She was brutally killed by D at that time, and despite having her memories being wiped after her rebirth she begins to suffer flashbacks and nightmares after their initial encounter; these are only worsened after she finds her own husk during the party's travels. She also initially admired the [[Queen of Keves]], but stopped admiring her after discovering that she is simply a robotic duplicate of the real [[Melia]].

== Story ==
40 years prior to the story, Eunie was a sharpshooter for [[Colony 18]], which eventually reached Gold Rank. However, once it did, it was destroyed by Consul D, who killed its soldiers with his immense speed and strength. He then proceeded to brutally kill Eunie, and her remaining life force was drained by the [[Ferronis]], leaving her a husk.

Many years later, Eunie was reborn, and became friends with Noah, Lanz, and [[Joran]]. Eventually, she started training with the other 1st termers at [[Colony 14]], until it was destroyed by Agnus forces. She then went on to work as Noah's bodyguard as a special forces unit alongside Lanz and [[Mwamba]] at Colony 9. After awakening as an [[Ouroboros]] following a top secret mission, she works alongside Noah, Lanz, and the former Agnus soldiers to reach [[Swordmarch]] and find a way to defeat the [[Moebius]].

== Gameplay ==
Eunie's initial [[Class (XC3)|class]] is the [[Medic Gunner]] class. Her [[Blade (XC3)|Blade]] is the Gunrod, which doubles as a gun and is able to heal allies in combat.

In a [[Chain Attack (XC3)|Chain Attack]], Eunie starts with 25 TP by default. Her Chain Art is [[Pinion Primed]], which reduces the enemy's ether defense during the Chain Attack by 30-50 percentage points (depending on her level) upon completing her order.

Eunie starts at Rank 5 in her initial Medic Gunner class when in the player's party for the first time.

=== Base Stats ===
These are Eunie's raw stats prior to modifications by class. They serve as a baseline for calculating Eunie's stats in a class. Intermediate values are linearly interpolated between these base stats.

=== General Stats ===
These stats assume Eunie is at level 99, at rank 20 in each of these respective classes, and is not equipping any [[Skill (XC3)|Master Skills]], [[Gem]]s or [[Accessory (XC3)|Accessories]]. Boosts from skills innate to a class are indicated with round brackets, whereas boosts from having an [[Blade Upgrade|upgraded Blade]] are indicated with square brackets.

== Etymology ==
Eunie may be a diminutive of [[wiktionary:Eunice|Eunice]], which derives from the Greek name [[wiktionary:&#917;&#8016;&#957;&#943;&#954;&#951;|&#917;&#8016;&#957;&#943;&#954;&#951;]] (Eun&#237;k&#275;) meaning "good victory". In the New Testament, [[wikipedia:Eunice (bible)|Eunice]] was the mother of Timothy, a companion of Saint Paul.
{{clr}}

== Trivia ==
* Eunie is the only High Entia among the soldiers that has large white wings instead of them matching her hair color.
** However, as can be seen in her concept art, and to an extent in-game, the tips of her feathers still match her hair color.
* Eunie shares her Japanese voice actress, Megumi Han, with [[Cheerio]].&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/XenobladeJP/status/1585182293827600384&lt;/ref&gt;
* Oddly, Eunie lacks any power frames in her Throwback outfit, even though Noah and Lanz have power frames incorporated into theirs.
