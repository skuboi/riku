'''Triton''' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|&#12488;&#12521;&#12452;&#12487;&#12531;}}, '''Triden''') is a character in {{XC3}}.

== Overview ==
Triton is the [[Consul]] of [[Colony 15]], as well as its commander. 

He can be recruited as a [[Hero]] by completing the [[Hero Quest]] ''[[Doing It My Way]]''. His [[Class Rank (XC3)|Class Rank]] is increased to 20 by completing the Ascension Quest ''[[My Memories]]''.

== Personality ==
Despite being a [[Consul]], he is sympathetic to the cause of [[Noah]] and his allies. Unlike all the other Consuls, he prefers being called by his original name rather than T. Old age has caused his memory to begin failing, and he admits that he can no longer remember how to assume his [[Moebius]] form. His original reason for becoming a Consul was the fear that his life was too short to get into the fights and adventures he wanted to have, but afterwards he realized that no lifetime could ever be enough for him to express his passions- what truly mattered was what he did with it. 

He is considered eccentric even by those who are fond of him, often making decisions based on peculiar leaps of logic (such as deciding that the coconut he found was more valuable than a fossil found by the party simply because it was larger). Nevertheless, he cares deeply for the people he views as friends and is willing to put himself in harm's way for their sake.

== Story ==
A sailor and a free spirit at heart, Triton came to wonder what his "crew" could accomplish if they were freed of the [[Flame Clock]]'s bondage, but found he could not do anything to dispose of it himself and was on the verge of giving up before hearing of Ouroboros' exploits. 

At some point during his travels across [[Aionios]], Triton befriended an unnamed traveler and joined him in his mission to gather ingredients for the perfect miso paste, leaving behind handprints at each location they visited so he'd remember where they went. At [[Syra Hovering Reefs]], Triton attempted to save his friend from being eaten by a monster but his friend instead accepted his death, requesting that Triton take his [[Miso]] paste and use it to make the best dish ever. Triton however, due to his forgetful nature completely forgot about his friend's request and even the reason the two of them began travelling together in the first place.

On one occasion he encountered Consul [[Irma|I]] carrying an empty treasure chest and offered her a Clammoth as treasure but she refused stating that treasure only has worth if you find it yourself, a sentiment Triton disagreed with.  Though the two Consuls disagreed and seemingly disliked each other, Triton would later consider her as a friend, feeling it lonely to think of her as a mere "acquaintance".

[[File:Consul T.jpg|thumb|240px|Triton meeting the party]]
After meeting Noah and his allies and coming to respect them after they clear a series of challenges to prove their worth, he allows them to destroy his Colony's Flame Clock and joins them as an ally, considering the idea of going up against his own kind to be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

While exploring the [[City]] with the party, he and the party are requested by [[Shiner]] to save his father, [[Playne]]. During this quest, ''[[A Young Noble's Request]]'', he runs into a couple members of Colony 15, who ran into Playne and helped him out. Colony 15&#8217;s soldiers are then brought to live in the City, with Triton only being allowed inside the City if accompanied by Ouroboros. However, after helping his soldiers with a scavenging mission during ''[[Colony 15 Soldiers Missing]]'', Triton is given permission to visit the City on his own at any time.

Later, Triton meets [[Jaggar]] at [[Michiba Canteen]] and the two of them quickly become good drinking buddies. The relationship he forms with Jaggar becomes important to Triton because Jaggar was the first person in the City to truly accept Triton. After a while, Jaggar tells Triton about his desire to eat a [[Bright Fig (XC3)|Bright Fig]]. Wanting to fulfill his friend's wish, Triton and the party travel to [[Low Maktha Wildwood]] to gather a ripe Bright Fig during the quest ''[[Friendship]]''. However, by the time they return to the City, Jaggar has already passed away. Still wanting to make good on his promise, Triton leaves the Bright Fig on one of the [[Remembrance Stones]] and pays his respects to his friend. 

Triton later joins Noah and his allies in their final battle against [[Z&#8734;]], where alongside all of the other Heroes they encountered on their journey, he can be summoned by [[Melia]] and [[Nia]] to help fight against [[X&#8734;]] or [[Y&#8734;]]. Since he was Moebius, Triton's fate after the defeat of Z is unknown.

== Gameplay ==
Triton's [[Class (XC3)|class]] is [[Soulhacker]], although unlike the version usable by the player, he himself has a limited set of Arts and Skills that are exclusive to him, and cannot change his [[Role]] from being an [[Attacker]]. His [[Battle Arts (XC3)|Chain Art]] is [[Barbarous Rage]], and his Heroic Chain bonus will cause his TP, whenever he reactivates, to be either increased or decreased by 50 at random. (If this causes his TP to drop below 0, then his TP will be set to 0).

=== Arts ===
* '''[[Final Countdown]]''' ([[Battle Arts (XC3)|Talent Art]])
* [[Captain Strike]] - Blowdown / Pierce
* [[Magnificent Fist]] - Art recharge on hit
* [[Peril Punch]] - AOE / Side Attack Up
* [[Pirate Lariat]] - [[Topple (XC3)|Topple]]
* [[Ultra Boost]] - Atk up/dmg up

=== Base Stats ===
These are Triton's raw stats prior to modifications by class. They serve as a baseline for calculating his stats in the Soulhacker class (see its page for the corresponding multipliers which adjust these stats). Intermediate values are linearly interpolated between these base stats.
{| class="xc1 centered" width="80%"
! Level !! HP !! Attack !! Healing Power !! Dexterity !! Agility
|-
| 1 || 503 || 28 || 26 || 33 || 21
|-
| 99 || 7,191 || 401 || 365 || 326 || 208
|}

=== General Stats ===
These stats assume Triton is at rank 20 in his class. Stat increases from gems are shown separately from the base stat, and may not fully apply if Triton has not unlocked the corresponding gem slots.
{| class="xc1 centered" width="100%"
!Level!!HP!!Attack
!Healing Power!!Dexterity!!Agility !!Critical Rate!!Block Rate!!Physical Defense!!Ether Defense
|-
|1||402|| 55 (+20)||9||39||23||15%||25%||20%||10%
|-
|99||5,752 ||1,101 (+70)||127|| 391||228||15%||25%||20%||10%
|}

Triton equips the following gems:
* [[Empowered Combo]]
* [[Steelcleaver]], at level 20 onwards
* [[Analyze Weakness]], at level 40 onwards

Triton equips the following accessories as his default accessories, which can be changed in post-game or [[New Game + (XC3)|New Game+]]. All equipped accessories assume their Common variant.
* [[Dark Orb (XC3)|Dark Orb]]
* [[Chipped White Brooch]], at level 30 onwards
* [[Hero Vambraces (XC3)|Hero Vambraces]], at level 50 onwards

He is often depicted as a fish-tailed merman with a conch shell that he blows like a trumpet.

== Quotes ==
* ''"Come back in about a billion years! Hahaha!"''

== Trivia == 
* Triton's English voice actor, Stanley Townsend, also voices the battle announcer in {{XC2}}.
* Triton is the only Consul to join the party as a Hero.
* Much of Triton's personality references the [[w:c:xenosaga:Captain|Captain of the Thames]] from ''[[w:c:xenosaga:Xenogears|Xenogears]]'', who similarly exclaims frequently that he is a ''"man of the sea"''.

== Class Stats ==
The Troubadour class grants the following multipliers to a character's base stats (see their individual pages for their base stats), and sets their Physical and Ether Defense to the following values, depending on their current Rank. Intermediate values are linearly interpolated between the minimum and maximum values, rounding to the nearest percent.
{| class="xc1 centered" width="100%"
! Rank !! HP !! Attack !! Healing Power !! Dexterity !! Agility !! Physical Defense !! Ether Defense
|-
| 1 || 55% || 55% || 110% || 105% || 90% || 5% || 25%
|-
| 10 || 55% || 57% || 112% || 107% || 95% || 7% || 27%
|-
| 20 || 55% || 60% || 115% || 110% || 100% || 10% || 30%
|}
=== Weapon Stats ===
The character's Attack stat after being modified by the above class stats is further modified by adding the class's weapon stat, which depends on the character's [[Level (XC3)|Level]], to obtain the final base Attack stat. These weapon stats also determine the character's Critical Rate and Block Rate. 

Characters temporarily assume these weapon stats to calculate relevant statistics when using a Master Art from this Class without it being part of a Fusion Art. If a Master Art is used in a Fusion Art, the weapon stats corresponding to the character's current Class will be used instead for calculations.&lt;!-- In the exercise of saving space, only every tenth level is displayed --&gt;
